Dear Hiring Manager,
I am interested in the listed position of medical records clerk at Centurion Medical. Working in the medical records department at a hospital like yours is a great opportunity as I work toward a nursing degree with evening classes at St. Helena University. Learning about how the medical records department works will be a step toward understanding how to best take care of patients with various conditions throughout the duration of their illness or injury.
I have worked in the medical records departments at two other hospitals, each with a slightly different way of doing things. Learning various methods to do the same job has made me more flexible and open to new ideas. Comparing these systems allowed me, in my last job, to suggest changes in record formatting that reduced paperwork errors by 20% over the first year of implementation.
In addition to my previous work at other hospitals, I have worked as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity in the field as well as doing work for Doctors Without Borders as a virtual assistant. With each opportunity, I learned to organize my time and to work well with many types of people. Those experiences also taught me how medical treatment differs and how to merge methods and ideas based on a patient's belief system.
I look forward to discussing my experience further with you at your earliest convenience. I believe that I can be a great asset to maintaining your hospital's sterling reputation for quality of care. My nursing education coupled with my professional and volunteer histories offer a unique perspective to medical recordkeeping. I would be honored to share my ideas on how to maintain and improve upon your record keeping systems.
Sincerely,
Amy Chan",The medical records clerk will be responsible for organizing and maintaining the medical records of the patients at the hospital. The clerk will work with the nursing staff to ensure that the records are accurate and up to date. The clerk will also work with the doctors and other medical staff to ensure that the records are complete and accurate. The clerk will also be responsible for keeping the records confidential and keeping them safe from unauthorized access.,"Amy Chan

Dear Hiring Manager,
It gives me great joy to have the opportunity to become the COO of Centurion Medical Research. I believe that with my drive, energy, superior organizational abilities and charisma, I can be a great COO for Centurion and ensure that it runs like a well-oiled machine. It would be a challenge, a privilege and an extraordinary opportunity for personal growth to be able to take charge of the day-to-day operations of such an important company â€” all things that appeal to me enormously and that will inspire me to do the best job that I can possibly do to help Centurion thrive.
In my life, I have been a serial entrepreneur. I have started multiple companies and have had to obsess over each and every aspect of their inner workings in order to nurture them into a good financial position. As such, I intimately recognize the importance of effective management. I know what makes a good manager, and I can embody those qualities. I can communicate plans and objectives, oversee projects and inspire employees in all parts of a company to be the best that they can be. Also, I understand that, sometimes, apparently small problems or inefficiencies in a company's operations can prove fatal over the long run if not addressed properly.
In addition to my entrepreneurial experience, I have also held various high-ranking executive positions at Innovation Medical Technologies. This not only gave me a close familiarity with the minutiae of the medical research business but also showed me the importance of establishing good communication with the company's CEO and other top executives. With this experience, I am motivated to be a capable COO.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I know that one way or another, countless companies live and die by the ways in which they handle their day-to-day operations. This is the bread and butter of any enterprise. It would be my honor to serve as COO of Centurion Medical Research and shoulder the supreme responsibility of ensuring that the company is on a path to success.

I am eager to learn everything there is about the Food Service Manager position for Crossover Software, the leader in software and technology systems. My specialty is to customize food menus for the food goals and budgets of my employer. I will work with you directly to determine the right ingredients, vendors and menu items for your team to ensure they remain productive, happy and healthy without breaking the bank.
My previous employer, Flagship Engineering, was a wonderful opportunity to fine-tune my food service managerial skills.

It was also my responsibility to select vendors, manage food staff and to provide customized meeting food service for elite guests.
During my previous position, I was tasked with the goal of cutting food costs by 12%, reducing food waste by 50% and creating a menu that incorporated healthier items that employees would actually eat. My aggressive initiatives resulted in reducing food costs by 14% and food waste by 62%.
Thank you for your time and consideration regarding the Food Service Manager position. I have been working diligently to create new menu items that reduce the use of meat without compromising flavors and nutrients that can be a significant asset to the productivity and health of your employees. I also strive to continue to learn new cooking techniques and methods to incorporate fresh fruits and vegetables as often as possible in new and exciting ways.

Dear Hiring Manager,
In my search for meaningful employment in health care, I have investigated areas that allow me some degree of flexibility. I believe that your position of Field Technician at Centurion Medical offers just that. My previous work as a Field Technician has taught me many things not only in health care but in dealing with IT issues and working with all kinds of people.
My experience as a Field Technician was with Flagiship Enterprises, a company that retrieved patient medical records for the purpose of insurance company auditing. My job was to travel throughout my state, going to medical offices and hospitals to retrieve the requested records via flash drive and upload them to the company at the end of the day. My efficiency scores in past two years were at 94% and 97%.
There are still some doctors who use paper charts. In those cases, I would copy the needed information and then scan and upload it to my office. As a Field Technician, I used different software programs that are made especially for EMRs. With medical fraud becoming so prevalent, programs are getting harder to crack, which means they're safer for patient information. Staff would often get nervous about me being in their files, but I was able to reassure them that I was there to help prevent fraud.
As a field technician for Centurion Medical, not only would I bring knowledge with me, but I would enjoy learning the ways your company teaches its Field Technicians in order to do the job your way. My main goal would be to do my job as quickly and efficiently as I could while helping the staff feel at ease. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am delighted to be applying for the position of Economist at Innovation Advertising. As someone with an analytical mind and a keen eye for quantitative data, I think I can truly bring something important to your company. Having my finger on the pulse of the markets and digging through information to try and discern upcoming trends is a combination of science and art that has always had great intellectual appeal to me. I simply love the way that data can line up and crystallize into a solid case for what the future might hold. It is that passion that I think will make me a useful member of Innovation Advertising's team as you seek to advise your clients.
During my previous role as an economic analyst for Flagship Financial Services, I analyzed reams of quantitative data and wrote reports in which I made recommendations to clients about likely trends in securities markets, performing both fundamental and technical analysis on various financial instruments. I am thus comfortable using advanced mathematical techniques to extract clues about the future of the economy from data of all types.
My experience has also shown me that there is an element of art and gut instinct to effective economic forecasting. My former team and I were able to increase the average profitability of our clients' investment portfolios by 20% on a year-over-year basis. I look forward to bringing my analytical acumen to Innovation Advertising to give your clients similar â€” or even greater â€” success.
I am grateful for your time and consideration, and I am excited to learn more about just what my responsibilities would be as an economist on Innovation's team. Market trends can often be quite obscure. Helping clients anticipate what is coming and more effectively modify and market their products, which in turn would only make their customers better able to get what they want, is already quite rewarding work on its own. I would be honored to lend my abilities to your firm.

I am greatly excited at the prospect of becoming a Maintenance Technician at Foundry Construction Corp. I've always enjoyed working with my hands, building things, repairing them, taking them apart and putting them back together again. I'm familiar with the workings of all kinds of mechanical and electronic devices likely to be found in most buildings, such as air conditioners, refrigerators, radiators, heating systems, microwaves, stoves, plumbing systems and more.

Working for Foundry would not only be an excellent opportunity for me to be of service to people who need a handyman, but it would also allow me to do something that I quite simply enjoy doing anyway.

However, I have an excellent mechanical intuition as well, which allows me to quickly figure out the inner workings of devices, even those I'm not familiar with.

Delicious food is a lifestyle to me, and I would love the opportunity to do the prep work for sumptuous dishes and sweet treats. I'm accustomed to working at a quick pace while also paying attention to details.

I would be thrilled to bring my skills and passion to Crossover Kitchen.
In my previous role as prep cook at Flagship Feast, I learned about food safety and the importance of sanitizing the prep table before starting work and between prepping different types of food. I also learned about the safety techniques used when dicing large quantities of vegetables, and I utilize all those valuable skills I learned to this day.
Throughout my time at Flagship Feast, I learned about other roles within a full-service restaurant because I actually worked other positions during my employment there too. I started as a dishwasher and held that position for three months. Then I learned more about the front of the house by working as a busboy for five months. I also went on to learn the hosting duties.

I further support a number of causes that I have seen Crossover Software dedicate its time and resources to over the past years. These include constant volunteering efforts, donations to various hospitals in the local markets and campaigns that raise awareness about social injustices.

I additionally attended multiple conferences where I spoke to hundreds of visitors about the proper organization skills over the past 12 months. Doing so helped me polish my public speaking skills and become the leader of large training sessions featuring dozens of new-hired employees.
I am constantly seeking new ways to develop myself and become a better resource for my subordinates.

Dear Hiring Manager,
Flagship Engineering has an impeccable reputation in our community, and I would be thrilled to become a part of this team as a Maintenance Worker. For three years, I have worked in the maintenance department at a small manufacturing plant. Because the plant was small, I received a lot of varied experience. I'm excited to get the chance to apply what I have learned to the maintenance department at Flagship.
Maintenance is more than just knowing how to use tools. I have an innate ability to diagnose a problem and intuitively know the steps required to fix it. At age 7, I was fixing my own bike and those of the neighborhood kids. By age 10, my father allowed me to start tinkering with an old truck he had. By the time I entered high school, I could take apart and reassemble any type of machine. After high school, I immediately entered the field of maintenance at my current job. After three months on the job, I had pinpointed and fixed a problem with one of their machines that had been ongoing for years.
When presented with a new tool, I only need a few minutes to figure out the mechanics of using it. When I take apart a machine, I have an almost photographic memory of where each part goes, so I can put it back together correctly. I am self-driven and don't mind putting in extra hours to solve a particularly tricky problem.
Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited to learn more about the duties required as a Maintenance Worker at Flagship.

My future goal is to be promoted to supervisor and then to manager so that I can bring my problem-solving skills to the next level.

I'm a very competent administrative assistant who is thoroughly conversant with spreadsheets and word processing. I'm experienced with office accounting procedures, preparing and editing business correspondence and maintaining a corporate calendar for executives.
While I attended Innovation University and pursued studies in bookkeeping and software applications, I also worked in the school office where I learned the practical aspects of properly handling documents and keeping files organized. While I was there, we shifted all files to a new computer system. Once we'd completed the process, efficiency increased by 20%. By the time I completed my associate's degree in business technology, I had absorbed much more than just coursework.
My first job after school was with Crossover Software, where I began as a receptionist but was soon promoted to a position as the office manager's assistant. I became proficient at spreadsheet preparation, business correspondence and travel arrangements. Whenever the office manager was unavailable, the responsibilities were all mine. In the several years I've been with this firm, it has tripled in size, and I'm proud to say that I helped with the reorganization and the growth.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to be able to apply for the open Systems Engineer position that you currently have at Innovation Technologies. I am able to bring an extreme focus on my work and a keen and incisive analytical intelligence to the job. I am simply fascinated by the way in which computer systems and networks function, and I never tire of learning more about them. Motivated by this passionate interest, I believe that I can be a valuable addition to your team as I will not tire until I find the cleanest and most efficient solution to whatever problem is put before me.
I have extensive experience designing, implementing and overseeing all aspects of computer systems â€”configuring routers, installing additional devices, designing encryption systems, collaborating with Systems Analysts to find and analyze data that might point to possible weaknesses in a network, monitoring and improving system performance and so on.
While working as a Systems Engineer at Centurion IT Consulting, I was required to exercise my curiosity and creativity to the maximum to discover why it was that business clients' private networks had been breached and to propose improvements to the design of those networks so as to minimize the possibility of future breaches. I found challenging analytical work like this, which required me to inventively collaborate with a broad range of different IT specialists, highly rewarding.
I am earnestly grateful to you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about precisely what needs Innovation Technologies has that I might be able to fulfill for you as a Systems Engineer and a trusted member of your team. As we move ahead through the hiring process, I will be excited to share and demonstrate my expertise to you and be of service.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I recently came across your job listing for the Retail Sales Associate position. I believe that I could prove to be an excellent fit for this job for many reasons. I'm familiar with what it takes to be successful as a sales associate due to the experience that I've gained while working at a similar store up until this point. I'm reliable and always willing to step up when shifts need to be covered. On my resume, you will find references that can attest to this.
In my four years of retail experience, I have gained valuable knowledge about working with a variety of Point of Sales systems. I am comfortable cashing people out and familiar with proper cash handling procedures. In the past, I've worked both the closing and opening shifts and was responsible for balancing the cash drawer and taking deposits to the bank each day. I have a 100% track record for accurate end-of-day balances. I've never been short a penny.
In addition to this, some of my other duties included creating displays, unpacking and stocking new merchandise, and assisting customers with any inquiries that they had about products. My past retail experience has taught me how good customer service can make or break the shopping experience, and I was able to gain valuable insight into how to keep interactions with customers positive. I was good at showing customers how to choose the item that fit both their needs and their budget, which earned me a 30% repeat customer base over two years, which was 5% above the average for sales associates at the store.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am interested in applying for the role of Sterile Processing Technician at Centurion Medical. I have been in the health care industry for the past 15 years and am ready to move into a job that requires the skills and responsibility that I have been building. I started at Centurion Medical working in food service and have worked my way up in other departments in the hospital. Currently, I am working as an orderly while I attend school at Clearwater University to become a Sterile Processing Tech.
My extensive background has given me insight into the workings of many areas of health care. My organizational skills have been honed, as has my compassion for others. I have enjoyed working the front lines of the cafeteria as well as working as a CNA and helping patients although I am also comfortable working independently.
When I was in school for my nursing certification, I did an internship at Centurion where I learned the importance of a sterile environment through on-the-job training. I was easily able to keep calm in a process I can only describe as a medical tag team. Sterilizing equipment directly affected a patient's health, and the medical professionals who used the tools I sterilized were responsible for the equipment from the second they touched it, which motivated my meticulous performance, resulting in a 99% accuracy rating from my supervisors.
I hope that my accomplishments will prove to be what you are looking for, and I look forward to an interview. I feel confident in my ability to ensure sterile surroundings for the hospital's patients. Thank you for considering me for the job of Sterile Processing Technician.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I see that your company is currently seeking out new hires for your Mental Health Therapist position, and I think I'd be an excellent fit for the role. I've completed internships, volunteered and worked at mental health facilities ever since I was a junior in high school. When I was in college and didn't qualify to work as a therapist, I still tried to get jobs that were related to the mental health industry even if it involved cleaning bed pans or working at the receptionist desk.
After I graduated high school, I went to St. Helena University and got a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I finished school with a 4.0 GPA and had several letters of recommendation from my teachers. Two months after I graduated, I landed an internship at a local mental health hospital where I learned how to give and review clinical assessments, monitor and record a patient's vital signs, create a safe and healthy environment for at-risk patients and attended therapy sessions hosted by other therapists.
Shortly after my internship ended, I went back to school and got my master's degree in Counseling. Then I took the National Board for Certified Counselors exam and passed with flying colors. I then started my job at Centurion Medical, where I was able to hold independent therapy sessions and assist clients in developing coping techniques.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It's with great pleasure that I'm responding to your advertisement for a Waiter at The Flagship Restaurant. I've been working in the restaurant industry for the last 15 years, and I love serving guests and creating a one-of-a-kind experience for them every time they're at one of my tables. Anticipating the needs of my guests is of paramount importance to me because I love helping restaurants grow their clientele, and I believe that creating a fun and friendly experience is one of the factors that I have the most control over as a Waiter. I do, however, also believe that guests want their order to be served correctly and in a timely fashion. That's why I work to communicate effectively with cooks and help other Waiters by expediting and running their tables' food.
In my previous position at Innovation Restaurant, I served guests by greeting them as soon as they were seated and by serving their drinks, most of the time, within two minutes of them having ordered. Innovation Restaurant has a quality-assurance program that uses secret guests who rate their experiences at the restaurant. For both of the two secret guests that I served, I was given perfect scores on timeliness of service and menu knowledge. I also helped management refine the training program so that new Waiters would better learn how to serve their guests.
I'm attentive to details and pride myself on my ability to communicate effectively with kitchen staff, bar staff, hosts and other servers. I also understand the functions and concerns of several of these roles because I've also worked as a host and bartender.
I'm so excited at the opportunity to learn about the food at The Flagship Restaurant and to connect with the restaurant's other Waiters and the guests. If hired, I'll be happy to help others learn techniques that create quality experiences for guests, and I'll continually be looking for ways to improve the service that I give.

I am thrilled to be applying to become an Airline Pilot at Centurion Airlines. From the very first time that I ever flew on a plane as a child and looked out the window, I've been fascinated by being in the air and decided then and there that I would become a pilot one day.

After earning my license, I began working as an Airline Pilot for Flagship Airlines, where I earned a reputation for thoroughness in making sure that every plane that I flew was properly fueled and that all of its equipment â€” particularly its safety and communications equipment â€” functioned properly. I am particularly experienced at flying Boeing 747s and 757s. I always bring a friendly and sunny attitude with me when speaking to passengers before, during or after a flight and am committed to making them feel comfortable and safe.
I am intimately familiar with all safety procedures in the event of any kind of equipment malfunction, bad weather or serious turbulence. Thankfully, in my 12 years as a commercial pilot, I have never encountered such serious issues, but I can be relied on to respond accordingly and prioritize passenger safety should they ever arise. I always make sure to communicate regularly and effectively with air traffic controller to stay abreast of all upcoming conditions on each of my flight paths.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It gives me great joy to be applying for the System Engineer position at Crossover Software. I believe that my strong problem-solving skills and organizational abilities make me a perfect fit for this position. I thrive on the significant challengesâ€”both technical and interpersonalâ€”that being a system engineer presents, and I am confident that my drive, my management skills and my broad base of technical knowledge will enable me to thrive in this role and provide Crossover and its business clients with tremendous value.
I have built up significant experience over a long career in a wide range of different IT jobs, ranging from Helpdesk Technician to Full Stack Developer, Network Engineer and Cybersecurity Engineer. This broad experience has given me a great deal of knowledge concerning all of the things that go into software development and the maintenance, functioning and protection of computer systems and networks. I have also interacted with many different customers over the years, assisting them with their technical issues and giving presentations in which I explain the workings of a new system, piece of software or security measure that I, and the IT professionals with which I have worked, have installed. Thus, I am proficient in both the organizational and technical aspects of being a System Engineer. In particular, I have been able to help many business clients streamline and integrate their software, security and network services, installing devices and improving the functioning of all aspects of their internal computer networks. These improvements have translated into an average increase in revenue for them of 10% within a few months.
I thank you wholeheartedly for your time and consideration. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute my expertise to helping your company run more smoothly and leave a long trail of satisfied customers. I am confident that I would be a great asset to Crossover Software's impressive IT team.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the available CMA position at Foundry Marketing. I recognize that a large company like Foundry engages in an extraordinarily complex set of financial transactions every day, holds varied assets of all over the world and must file an intricate tax return each year. Properly recording all of this information, assessing the value of Foundry's assets and predicting its likely future financial performance requires a skilled and meticulous hand. I pride myself on the care and precision with which I always approach my work, and I have the ability to synthesize vast quantities of information. I believe that these traits and skills make me a natural fit for this role.
By passing the extremely rigorous certification exam and becoming a CMA, I have demonstrated a deep knowledge of accounting and actuarial principles, financial reporting, business analysis and strategic business management. As such, I not only have a strong understanding of the technical accounting end of the responsibilities involved in this position but am a capable manager as well. My managerial expertise is further bolstered by the fact that I have started and run a number of companies of my own â€” hiring personnel, managing accounts, preparing and submitting financial records, filing taxes and seeking ways to improve company performance.
I have been employed in a number of managerial roles at other companies throughout my career as well. In particular, I served as CFO of a small investment advisory firm called Centurion Financial Group. This role required me not only to meticulously examine and prepare financial data but also oversee the operations and performance of numerous investment advisers and stockbrokers as they invested clients' money. At that time, I presided over an average annual growth rate of investor portfolios of 19%.
Thank you very much for your time and attention in considering me for this crucial position. I truly believe that with me at the helm of its financial records, Foundry Marketing can perform exceptionally well in the years ahead. It would be my privilege to assume the responsibilities of a CMA at Foundry. As we move ahead in the hiring process, I humbly hope that I may be accepted into ranks of this impressive firm.
Sincerely,

I'm excited to be applying for the Development Associate position at Innovation Advertising. I am looking for a role that will allow me to expand my hands-on responsibilities, and this seems like the ideal fit due to your organizational goals of employee independence and proactive behavior.
At Foundry Marketing, I was tasked with the responsibility of finding leads for future business and new accounts. I was able to capitalize on using social media platforms as a way to discover untapped resources. My selection process was carefully tailored to the overall goals of the business and the products and services offered by the company. As a result, client conversions increased from a 22% rate to a 43% rate.
I also saved the company money by reducing the amount of time salespeople spent on their own lead development and relationship fostering on clients who were not a good fit for the company. It is estimated that conversion times reduced from an average of 15 hours to 8 hours, which equates to over $150,000 annually.
Thank you kindly for your time and consideration. My aspirations of continued career growth by using my continued education in business development skills align perfectly with the Development Associate role at Innovation Advertising. Together, we will increase sales with more efficiency to save everyone time and money and make the lives of the team easier.

I learned about an opening at Foundry Marketing for a Grant Writer at the American Grant Writers' Association Conference last week. I'm excited to be applying to a leader in the field of marketing. Foundry Marketing has been a staple in the field ever since my grandfather was an ad writer. I grew up hearing him talk about the talented writers at Foundry.

Dear Hiring Manager,
After 20 years as a floor nurse, the time has come for me to transition to helping other nurses learn essential skills for patient care. I was thrilled to see an opening for a Nurse Educator at such a renowned hospital as Centurion Medical. I have worked with nurses trained at Centurion, and they were some of the best nurses I have ever seen. I'm excited to bring my many years of hands-on experience to a new group of nurses. As a male nurse in a female-dominated field, I will bring a new perspective to the existing nurses. I balance logic with empathy when caring for patients, and I want to teach other nurses to find this balance.
After finishing my BSN, I worked for seven years in the Emergency Department before going back to school for my MSN. I kept working almost full-time while I completed my degree through Clearwater University. I entered the nursing field because I want to care for patients, but as I was promoted, I did less bedside care and more administrative tasks. My current role as a nursing supervisor gave me a balance between patient care and administration that I thoroughly enjoyed.
When I entered college, I was still unsure if I wanted to be a teacher or a nurse. I chose nursing with the thought that someday I could teach. I ended up loving taking direct care of the patients and now look forward to the transition of being a Nurse Educator. I've been given the DAISY award seven times in my career. I have also earned an Excellence in Nursing award twice. I have many ideas of how to improve nursing care at the bedside and within the care plans. I am excited to implement some of these plans. The group I was managing in my last position worked hard to reduce patient falls from 3% to 0.5%.
Thank you for considering me for this position. I'm looking forward to visiting with you about Centurion Medical's strategic view for the future and how nurses will help shape that role. I will continue to work tirelessly to bring each and every nurse in your employ to their full potential.

I am excited to learn more about the Director of Development position at Innovation Advertising. My unique ability to connect with people is my secret weapon in business development that you can benefit from greatly. I have a knack for disarming the resistance of new business opportunities and finding a way to present influential information without it seeming like a sales pitch.
During my time at Foundry Marketing, I was able to implement dozens of strategic relationships that grew the business by 37%. It was my ability to select the right potential partners and to find the ways our businesses complement one another rather than to be seen as competition that made such efforts a great success.
I spend much of my time working with the marketing and sales departments to learn everything I can about target markets and the analytics of sales and marketing campaigns. This helps me to determine whether or not target markets are right for products and services. By making target market shifts in the past, I have increased sales by 43% for some product lines and eliminated other products entirely due to poor performance. This resulted in saving the company $250,000 annually while improving branding to secure an additional 21 new business accounts valued at $2.5 million.
Thank you for taking time out of your busy day. It is my feeling that your desire and my ability to expand business opportunities are in perfect alignment for the Director of Development position.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It's with great pleasure that I'm answering your posting for the Interior Designer position. As in many endeavors in life, I believe that interior design is essentially about a few major things: attention to detail, a stroke of inspiration and a focus on where practicality and beauty converge. I like making clients happy, but I love when I can give them something that they didn't even know they wanted. Getting to know clients and understand their needs is of utmost importance to me during the beginning stages of any project. I'm excited to get to know the other designers at Innovation Interior Design to continue to learn new techniques, and I would be so pleased to be able to bring my current experience to the company.
In my previous role at Flagship Designers, I worked with a wide variety of clientele, and I pride myself on being able to make almost anyone's budget work. Some clients only have a few thousand dollars per room, but other clients want a high-end design and have the budget for it. Even though some homeowners can't spend as much, it's still a priority for me to give them something that will be functional and aesthetically pleasing for years to come. Thankfully, there are many materials on the market today that I can use to create a high-end look without breaking the budget.
Although I completed my degree in interior design at Clearwater University several years ago, I also stay updated on the latest trends in interior design. It's extremely important to know which techniques and products will make a room look fresh and which ones will make rooms feel dated. That's why I spend five hours every week looking at some of the newer interior design books and researching the available products that manufacturers are making today.
I want to thank you for your time and for considering me for the Interior Designer position at Innovation Interior Design. I look forward to talking to you in person and talking more about the position.

If the materials passed muster, I then had the seats tested for protection during simulated car crashes. This methodology resulted in a reduction in the number of returned products by 75% and satisfaction among the team that we were providing a safe product for children.
I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Westwood University as well as industry certifications. I possess a highly trained engineering skillset and have spent several years in a leadership role, overseeing up to 15 people, ensuring that quality assurance teams were well trained and following protocol. With my extensive experience, I am confident that I can provide valuable testing oversight to Flagship Engineering.
Thank you for your consideration of my application. I am looking forward to hearing more about the position of Quality Engineer, and I hope to learn more about the goals and culture of Flagship Engineering. I am excited at the opportunity to speak with you about the contributions I can make to your team.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It gives me great pleasure to apply to become an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at St. Helena University and begin my academic career. I have an abiding, passionate and almost obsessive interest in mathematics that began when I first encountered the work of Georg Cantor in high school. Since then, I have developed strong interests in model theory and category theory and have published a dissertation on methods of drawing factors between categories in Lattice Theory and Boolean Algebra, up to isomorphism. Beyond my research interests, I am an effective communicator and have earned praise from undergraduate students for my ability to explain complex mathematical ideas in a simple and understandable fashion.
I earned my Ph.D. from Clearwater University and wrote my thesis on the ways that category theory can be used to reveal illuminating connections between Lattice Theory and Boolean Algebra, ultimately showing that classical logic itself can be modeled as a lattice. From this, my research interests progressed into Lie Groups like E8, given the natural connection between these groups and lattice structures.
While pursuing research in these areas, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant at Clearwater, teaching freshman students elementary calculus and giving sophomores their first taste of how to write formal proofs in another course. Through it all, I graded tests and homework assignments and was praised for the clear and intuitive way I explained concepts to students. I was able to help more than 20 students during those years who were struggling to pass their classes. On average, their grades went from Ds to Bs under my tutelage.
Thank you deeply for your kindness and attention in considering me for this position. I hope that as we move forward through the hiring process, I will be given an opportunity to demonstrate my value as an instructor and researcher. The ability to devote my life to pursuing mathematical research and imparting my knowledge to eager and talented students at St. Helena is simply a dream come true. I would be honored to have a place at your fine university.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to have the opportunity to apply to become a Public Defender at the Flagship County District Court. I chose to become a lawyer because I believe in justice. I believe that the law should be there to serve everyone, especially those who are less fortunate. I further believe that a society can be judged by how well it treats its poorest and most disadvantaged citizens. It is this cluster of strongly held ethical beliefs that will be the fire and motivating force behind all of my work in my legal career â€” especially the work that I do to give legal representation to the poor and marginalized. With my convictions driving me and every ounce of my intelligence, legal knowledge, persistence, eloquence and writing skills placed utterly and entirely at the service of my clients, I believe that I will be able to do good in the world and help people secure justice in Flagship County.
After graduating with high honors from Clearwater Law School and passing the Bar Exam, the doors of the world swung wide open to me. Rather than installing myself at a major law firm and enjoying a lucrative career, however, I felt myself called to public service. That is why I have chosen to return home to Flagship County and give back to the community in which I was raised.
I bring with me the extensive knowledge of tort and criminal law with which my rigorous education at Clearwater equipped me. I can bring an indefatigable energy to bear on all of the cases on which I will be tasked to work. As you will see from my resume, my record at law school is superb, and I have a glowing recommendation from Crossover County District Court judge Hector Silva, for whom I worked as legal clerk. I'm a superior communicator whether writing or speaking, and I will walk into the courtroom at every opportunity with a passion to make sure that justice is served.
I humbly thank you for your time and consideration in examining me for this position. I have been told that I brim with idealism, and I do not shy away from this description. The poor, disadvantaged and downtrodden need an idealist on their side who truly believes in preserving and upholding their rights. If given the opportunity to do so here at the Flagship County District Court, I will eagerly jump in.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
As a Production Manager at Crossover Software, I will bring 15 years of experience to the table. I have managed teams of up to 100 employees and know my multi-tasking and communication skills can be a help to your production team. I have a passion for exceeding production goals while maintaining the highest safety standards. I was previously working in a boat manufacturing plant and am excited to transfer my skills into manufacturing software parts.
After completing my business degree at Clearwater University, I immediately went into production. I started as a supervisor and was quickly promoted to Production Manager. I view production as a puzzle and work diligently to get all the pieces to fit together. Balancing cost analyses with production schedules can be a difficult process, but I have continually met or exceeded the company's goals.
A good manager listens to those under him, but a great manager considers what they say and puts those ideas into play. I regularly met with staff members to discuss the direction we were going in and the direction we wanted to go in. By listening to the staff, I was able to pinpoint the weaknesses in our process. We implemented a new process that increased production by 35% without sacrificing quality or safety. By leaning on my staff for input, I created a workplace environment that made them feel that they were a valued part of the team. By doing so, I had the lowest rollover rates of any department.
Thank you for considering my application. I am ready and eager to apply what I have learned in the last 15 years to a new sector. I look forward to learning more about your current processes and the goals your company has set. As a Production Manager, I will work tirelessly to meet those goals.

Dear Hiring Manager,
Flagship Factories is an inspiring, large-scale manufacturer, and this gives me great enthusiasm as I apply to be one of its machinists. I grew my love for machines before I obtained a formal education in the field. Both my passion and experience can be used to keep your factories operating to their full potential. I look forward to learning more and getting a better understanding of why those at Flagship Factories are held in high regards.
Drafting and metalworking are skills I mastered at Innovation University. I began my interest in machining with an apprenticeship program when I was only a teenager. I took my knowledge of mechanical drawing and trigonometry into my active career with Foundry Metalworks. Creating precision parts requires safety above all else. I want to create a productive environment to work in your factories. Bending, shaping and grinding metal requires machines that are heavy; you need people who can safely use them.
Understanding the exact patent or design for any metal form that we produce is important. A precise understanding of the blueprints results in exactly what the engineer measured up. From aluminum to steel, I kept every detail to the measurements specified. Knowing how to create forms from a drawing is my core skill. I set the standard of keeping my machine tools stationary to generate ideal power, and that's part of why I start my inspections early in the day and before anything gets started. Each inspection gave my team the feedback it needed.
Thank you for looking closer at my potential as a team member at your company. I hope you see the benefit in having my knowledge and skills on your team. Attention, promptness and accuracy are just a few things that I stand for as a machinist.
Sincerely,

I have been a real estate agent for more than seven years. I enjoy the excitement of my clients looking at beautiful properties while closing the sale for their dream homes. I look forward to serving your clients and implementing my knowledgeable expertise in real estate sales at Innovation Advertising.
I graduated from Innovation University with a bachelor's degree in real estate management. At my previous position, I developed my skills in negotiation, communication, property closing and business solutions integration. I obtained my real estate license after graduating from Innovation University. Since that time, I have sold more than 500 homes. In 2017, I produced a 15% increase in sales from the previous year and made top salesperson of the year for my company.
One of my most desirable duties as a real estate agent was designing and maintaining the company database of available homes. I was able to effectively market aesthetically pleasing homes to the company's client base while providing substantial opportunities for investors with distressed properties.

I also prioritize successful completion of all projects within the predetermined deadlines.

Through the constant use of my attention to detail, I was able to keep our rate of defective items down to less than 2% of each batch. This allowed the company to decrease the cost of returns by an average of 20% in each year that I supervised the manufacturing process.

I am writing to express my interest in the Training Specialist position at Flagship Engineering. I am confident that I meet the requirements specified in your online advertisement, including using sound judgment, along with rubrics, to choose the type of training that will best meet all required outcomes. My outgoing and engaging personality helps me connect and develop a rapport with my intended audience. I enjoy technical training the most, which is one of the reasons I have decided to apply to Flagship Engineering.
Throughout my career, I have developed job aids and quick reference guides, and I have maintained technical user documentation. Furthermore, I have knowledge of multiple training methods. In my current role, I use my strong presentation skills to train staff members who work in different departments. Because I train staff across the organization, I rely on my ability to take technical information and make it more accessible for our non-technical employees. Since I am bilingual, your company will gain a dedicated trainer who has the ability to take training documents and translate them into Spanish.
I excel at working with subject matter experts to obtain training requirements, and I make sure I build those requirements into my training programs and their accompanying documents. I then create surveys to measure their effectiveness, making modifications if needed. Because of my skillset, my previous training manager asked for my assistance in implementing more blended learning programs, which increased company productivity by 23%. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Science in instructional design, and I take ongoing courses to stay abreast of adult-learning principles and new technologies.
Becoming your next Training Specialist will give me the opportunity to take my career to the next level.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am delighted to apply for the position of Research Analyst at Centurion Financial Group. As someone who is highly analytical, I enjoy sifting through information in order to discover and extract what is most important in a given set of material. Working in such a data-driven career aligns well with my natural aptitudes. I believe that for this reason, I will be a valuable addition to the team of analysts working at Centurion.
I hold two bachelor's degrees from Clearwater University â€“ one in finance and one in mathematics. My education in finance involved a detailed study of the principles of technical analysis and risk models. I learned to read chart patterns and determine likely infection points for securities. Fundamental analysis also played a key role in my financial education, and I am familiar with key indicators of a stock or other investment's true value, such as P/E ratio. In studying mathematics, I learned many mathematical techniques not typically taught to undergraduate finance students and especially focused on probability statistics. I am able to apply these techniques to create and analyze more complex risk models.
As a financial Research Analyst for Crossover Research Group, I conducted research into various securities in order to make reasonable forecasts of those securities' future price action using a combination of principles from both fundamental and technical analysis. I applied complex risk models to determine the best point at which to enter and exit a given market, increasing investor portfolio profitability by more than 15%.
Thank you for your time in considering me for the Research Analyst position. I believe that with my skills, I can contribute my efforts as a diligent researcher who can get to the bottom of the true financial state of any company. I look forward to examining and forecasting the markets as a member of your team.

I have a history of leading others to successful outcomes in a professional setting, and I believe I would be the ideal candidate to fill this vacancy. I'm excited by all the challenges inherent in the position and look forward to the opportunities it presents.
Leadership has been a part of who I am for most of my life. I was both president of my university's German culture club and captain of the baseball team. In both capacities, I oversaw the other members, led by example and helped to plan and execute various activities, including fundraisers. Simultaneously, I maintained an academic scholarship and tutored underprivileged youngsters. These life lessons prepared me for my first job at a car rental agency where I was promoted to a managerial role within a year of being hired. Under my direction, sales increased by 18%, and cancellations dropped by 34%.

This charged me with leading a team of diverse and talented individuals while coordinating between departments in order to craft a marketing approach that would make both my employer and the client successful. Thanks to good communication, a strong team work ethic and my leadership, we were able to complete every project at least two days prior to the deadline. The ads themselves were also quite effective.

Your position for Machine Operator at Foundry Mining is no small matter to me. I see myself as part of your team because I know that mining is only successful when you can eliminate delays and hazards. I want to ensure that everyone at your factories and sites always has machine power.
I first learned about tool and die making at Clearwater University. This is where I picked up a sound education in algebra, probability and trigonometry. I then worked as a full-time Machine Operator at Centurion Factories. From then on, it was clear that safety would be my central aim before and after each shift. Heavy machinery is only helpful when it performs to our standards â€“ or better. With the rise of technology and IT programming, I took advantage of my personal time to better understand how computers would improve workflows.
Automation and timing are key ingredients for machines today, and you can rely on my complete knowledge in these areas. Keeping mining equipment in order means a routine of checks and repairs. My daily inspections covered every detail of the company's machines, both inside and out. I take pride in writing notes and creating a journal so that others can pick up where I left off. At Foundry Mining, you need to consistently move layers of earth with high-powered hydraulics. Consider my keen eye for keeping machines intact and eliminating any hazards they face.
The engineers that I've worked with are all part of an important process in developing a team. Teaching your workers about the safety standards of every machine is possible, so thank you for reading my letter. I look forward to you showing me how I can take the next steps as your Machine Operator.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm delighted to be applying for the open Network Engineer position at Flagship Engineering. I believe that with my effective and well-honed analytical and troubleshooting skills, I can add value to your infrastructure by smoothing along all of the communications between your company's networked devices. Given how many important company activities take place across computer networks these days, I understand that this is a position that carries great responsibility with it. However, with my diligence, problem-solving skills and openness to learning from all those with whom I work, I believe that I would be an asset to Flagship Engineering.
I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Westwood University. To further improve my skills in the area of computer networking, I passed the certification exams for Cisco's CCNA and CCNP routing and switching program, which required me to set up a network of my own, configure a wide host of devices for it, ensure that all routers were functioning properly and then resolve a wide array of actual issues that would be inflicted upon the network. In particular, as part of my CCNP certification exam, I was able to restore a network's functioning and remove all malware infecting it within two hours of Cisco's technicians having sabotaged the network.
After this, I interned for a year at Crossover Software, learning the trade from more experienced network engineers. While working with a group of other interns and more experienced technicians, I was able to help increase network efficiency and cut down on latency by 15%. Thus, I have a good deal of hands-on experience with all aspects of networks and how they function.
I thank you for your time and consideration in examining my qualifications for this position. I very much look forward to continuing to the next stage of the hiring process with Flagship. From there, I hope to start a fulfilling and productive career in which I will be able to learn from other IT engineers on your team and become a part of the Flagship Engineering family.
Sincerely,
Jensen Pope",The Network Engineer will be responsible for managing and troubleshooting the company's computer network.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to apply to become an Industrial Engineer at Flagship Engineering. This position will allow me to make the most out of my penchant for systematic thinking and my organizational bent. I am an extremely conscientious worker who understands the importance of following a plan and of making sure that all parts of a project â€” both mechanical and human â€” are running smoothly.
As befits an industrial engineer, I have advanced knowledge of physics, mathematics, engineering principles and industrial processes. My experience working as an Industrial Engineer for Centurion Petroleum Corp. has familiarized me with how to examine procedure plans and implement steps to improve efficiency, conduct reliable and accurate maintenance checks, coordinate teams of workers to efficiently bring large-scale projects to life, entering results into databases, generating and examining records and presenting my results to superiors in anticipation of further instruction. I have also garnered a reputation for my management abilities and my way of fostering a collaborative spirit among the engineers whom it is my responsibility to direct. I have found that a spirit of openness that encourages all members of the team to submit design proposals or other suggestions during a project tends to foster team cohesion.
As a result of my efforts leading a team of Junior Engineers, I was able to ultimately improve Centurion's ability to extract petroleum and to cut its production costs by 6% and 11%, respectively.
Thank you very much for your time and attention in considering me for this all-important role. I have demonstrated an ability to apply rigorous critical attention to problems of maximizing industrial efficiency, and I hope to prove my mettle as we progress further along in the hiring process. I would be honored to put my abilities to work for you and become a part of the family at Flagship Engineering.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing today to express interest in the construction worker position currently available at Flagship Engineering. As someone who greatly enjoys working with my hands and has a high level of technical knowledge related to buildings and construction, the opportunity to work with one of the biggest engineering companies in the country is an exciting prospect. Given the importance of construction-related work within a given community, I am eager to begin work with Flagship and put my experience to good use.
I have worked in construction for most of my adult life, giving me a high degree of experience working with materials ranging from stone, wood, plaster, glass, metal and more as well as associated tools for each. Much of my experience lies in renovation, particularly in my previous job at Innovation Home Improvement where I was tasked with tearing down segments of domestic homes to rebuild in new ways.
Throughout my time working for several companies, I received praise for my detail-oriented approach to construction and intuitive sense on how best to take apart different areas. Thanks to my contributions, jobs would typically be completed a couple of days ahead of schedule without compromising the integrity of the finished project. Additionally, my supervisors tended to place me in charge of helping keep others on track during larger jobs, delegating certain tasks and responsibilities to me in order to ensure my team stayed on track and was able to adapt to new orders and plans without delay.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. If you have any questions regarding my qualifications or skills, please don't hesitate to ask. I look forward to learning more about the work that needs to be done at Flagship Engineering and hope to hear back from you soon.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It's a great sensation in seeing myself as a part of Centurion Construction. I understand that you need a competent Heavy Equipment Operator. My most valuable skills as a Heavy Equipment Operator were obtained with on-the-job experience. I also learned through formal classes and with diverse construction plans from my job sites. In addition, I have the credentials to drive excavators, loaders and skids. I look forward to discovering how my skills can be put to use on my next project. I hope that you can consider what I have to offer as you build your team and achieve the specs in your blueprints.
I began my career as a laborer by first obtaining a construction technology degree from Westwood University. I then obtained a position at Innovation Development to nurture my skills through real-world applications and make my impact as a manual laborer. During my time there I was faced with heavy materials, large construction zones and the need to carefully organize projects from beginning to end.
It became apparent that hand and foot coordination is as important as breathing. Keeping my eyes opened and focused allowed me to maintain control of every vehicle. I learned how important it is to communicate while driving. The start of my work is only possible once I complete a site inspection. I ensure that every machine is in working order. You can rely on my equipment maintenance to keep all the joints, tracks and panels in their top conditions.
The ideal conditions aren't always possible, however. But by being able to adjust to the environment, I developed my skills as a workman--which is something that could take years to develop. Thank you for this line of communication within my letter. Please share with me the things that I can expect as your Heavy Equipment Operator.

I am a motivated self-starter with the ability to manage my time and thrive in an independent position with little need of oversight, making me an excellent candidate to get the job done.
Much of my previous employment history has involved driving or transportation in some form. As a school bus driver for the local high school, I was in charge of driving dozens of students to and from school every weekday, including for field trips. This has taught me the value of getting where I need to go in a safe but timely manner as my actions as a driver affect more than just myself.
Working as a driver for Centurion Transportation, I was in charge of hauling several thousand units of product to and from various locations. These trips would often see me driving across the country and making hundreds to thousands of miles in a single round trip depending on the destination. Through it all, I was commended on my 87% efficiency rating and ability to make the most of my time each day before stopping.
Thank you for taking the time to read over my letter and consider my application. Truck driving is a lifestyle I greatly enjoy, and I believe I have much to offer the company with my many years of experience. As a trucker, I have every intention of continuing to perform above and beyond at the job I've dedicated so much of my life to.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to have the opportunity to apply to be an Archivist at the Foundry National Museum. With my naturally orderly mind and penchant for organization, I think I can be a great fit for the position. I also love examining and studying ancient manuscripts and codices, dating them, preserving them and so on. Because I love it so much, I would be happy to share my enthusiasm with others, striving to help all visitors to the museum find and examine whatever records or ancient documents they require.
In addition to my ability to carefully and precisely organize every document and entry in your massive collection, I am able to interact with people in a friendly but efficient manner. I am able to easily search through a computer database to find necessary documents, thus enabling me to be of help to large numbers of museum visitors throughout the day.
Along with my organizational and interpersonal skills, I studied classics at Clearwater University, giving me a fluent understanding of Greek, Latin and other ancient languages. With this comes the ability to determine which purportedly ancient documents are authentic. I am also familiar with the basic principles of paleography, codicology and manuscript illumination, enabling me to be an effective research aid to those interested in examining ancient documents.
I thank you deeply for your time and your kindness in considering me for this position. Being an Archivist at the Foundry National Museum would give me an extraordinary opportunity not only to examine your world-renowned collection of manuscripts and documents but also to direct others to find the information they need and assisting them in their research. I truly feel at peace seeing neatly catalogued and labeled documents organized on shelves, and I know that, once we proceed through the hiring process, I will feel at home working at the Foundry National Museum.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to throw in my hat as an applicant for the open DevOps Engineer position at Flagship Engineering. I have the analytical mind necessary to write code and the big-picture mentality to make it innovative and unique. I also enjoy overseeing projects, organizing people and channeling them into areas where they can make the best use of their talents. I'm thrilled at the prospect of becoming a part of your team at Flagship and placing my abilities at your service.
I began my IT career as a front-end developer at Crossover Software. My first job entailed working with teams of developers to write apps with varying functionalities from mobile games to search algorithms and malware detection packages. Collaborating with other developers not only honed my coding skills but also taught me the value of how to effectively work with others and subdivide tasks to improve efficiency and ensure smooth teamwork. I then became a cybersecurity technician with Centurion Technologies, designing encryption software and instructing clients in its use.
With my experience in software development, cybersecurity and public speaking, I later decided to combine my skills and become a DevOps Engineer at Innovation Software Solutions. With me at the helm coordinating development and IT Operations team, I was able to design CI/CD pipelines that improved the company's ability to design, debug and release software by 20%.
I am honored to have to opportunity to apply my unique set of skills to assist your organization and its clients. I don't believe there is any contradiction between appreciating the logic in tightly-written software and being a people person, and I look forward to showing you how I can combine these things as we move along in the hiring process.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am pleased to apply for the position of LVN at Centurion Medical. I worked as an EMT before I joined the military and during my time as a medic in Afghanistan the last two years of my deployment. After those experiences, I decided I wanted to go to medical school and focus on emergency medicine for the VA.
I realize that LVN work is not necessarily emergency medicine. A large part of my EMT work and my time as an Army medic consisted of run-of-the mill, non-emergent treatment. In addition to being a medic, I worked in an Afghan clinic during off-hours. Though the town was in the middle of a war zone, I logged more than 150 hours treating the townspeople for regular colds, fevers and broken bones. I also went to their homes and treated them when they were not able to travel to the clinic.
One of the reasons I wanted to become a Licensed Vocational Nurse is that it is a slightly different area than certified nursing assistant or registered nurse. I am able to take on more responsibilities than a CNA, such as giving injections and starting IVs. I have not decided if I want to continue to RN or stay an LVN while I work toward medical school.
One of the lessons I learned in the military is that life is short. Regardless of my job, be it EMT, medic, LVN or doctor, it's important to help people in any way I can. Medicine is the way I choose to help. I hope to get the opportunity to work with Centurion Medical in my journey. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Upon review of your posting for an Assistant Manager at Centurion Medical, I felt compelled to apply for the position. As someone with a reputation for attention to detail and accuracy, I look forward to playing a role in helping to maintain your company's reputation as a leader in the medical supply industry. Because of my experience working in medical offices, I believe I would fit in well at your company.
From preparing reports and quarterly earnings statements in a timely, organized manner to implementing office procedures designed to improve efficiency and ensure data accuracy, my background in all aspects of office management in a medical setting has prepared me for this role. Solid leadership, time management and communication skills are among the additional strengths I would draw from if given the opportunity to be part of your team.
While working at Crossover Medical in a similar position, I accomplished the goal of optimizing revenue and minimizing billing errors in two key ways. First, I implemented an updated invoicing process by recommending the purchase of new software designed to track all invoices and flag late or incomplete payments so that such issues could be addressed ASAP. Secondly, I took the initiative to suggest a more efficient method of responding to and resolving client concerns, which resulted in a nearly 25% increase in repeat business over a one-year period.
Also while working at Crossover Medical, I frequently trained new office staff. During the training sessions I conducted, I routinely stressed the importance of efficiency and accuracy with coding. I was commended by upper management for contributing to a 21% increase in office staff retention during my seven years with the company.

Dear Hiring Manager,t
I am pleased to apply for the position of therapist at Centurion Mental Health Services. People have always been a source of fascination for me. I have always been both naturally empathetic and voraciously curious, and the combination of these two qualities created a strong desire to understand the inner workings of the human mind. I sought to use my knowledge to help those who are suffering. It has been a privilege to devote my professional life to helping people in that way.
I completed my doctorate in Psychology at St. Helena University. Though I have extensive knowledge of the effects and uses of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of mental disorders, I have chosen to focus the bulk of my professional energy on talk therapy.
After becoming a licensed therapist, I began practicing at the Innovation Mental Health and Brain Sciences Institute. There, groups of trained psychologists, psychiatrists and cognitive scientists would work to conduct research on the brain to discern the origins of various mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia. In particular, my role was to meet with patients, hold talk therapy sessions with them to try and discover the source of their mental illnesses, provide them with insight into their own conditions. When needed, I would ask psychiatric colleagues to prescribe medication. Most of the time, I would simply be there for them and listen to their problems. I took detailed notes during each session with each patient and compiled extensive documentation on them in an effort to help them. With my strong interpersonal skills, I would try to get to the heart of what was troubling my patients while making sure to always treat them with compassion. With my help, as many as 70% of patients with all but the most serious conditions would return to living productive lives within a year.
I thank you for your time and attention in considering me for this position. It would be an honor to be able to work alongside the gifted professionals at Centurion to help patients. I looking forward to proceeding further through the hiring process and becoming a trusted member of your team.

I am excited to see that a Geologist position has become available at Centurion Engineering. I am currently in the last year of my master's program in geology at Clearwater University. I have maintained an internship with your company since September 19, 2016. While I have enjoyed my internship, I would love the opportunity to become a more permanent member of your team.

I assisted the lead geologist with mapping reservoirs using AVO modeling to study seismic trends at the survey sites. Some of my other responsibilities included creating presentations from the data collected and maintaining 100% accurate records of the samples collected from each site. My position in the department made me accustomed to the risk management and safety protocols that Centurion Engineering has established as your standard guidelines.
I maintained a 4.0 GPA and graduated at the top of my class with honors when obtaining my bachelor's degree. During my undergraduate years, I participated in volunteer programs where I organized and led a team to assist in natural disaster cleanup. I am currently in the second year of my master's program and am working on a thesis based on my accomplishments through my internship.
While these are just a few of my accomplishments, I have enclosed a more detailed resume for you to review at your leisure.

I am responding to a job advertisement posted by your company. I would love to take up the open position for Patient Care Coordinator at Centurion Medical. As a health care professional, I have over 10 years of experience working as a Dietary Aide, a Nurse's Assistant and a Patient Care Technician.
I graduated from Westwood Technical College with an associate degree in medical assistance, and I've completed a Patient Care Technician certification program at Westwood Technical College.

These programs taught me medical terminology, anatomy, physiology, medical ethics, office administration, nutritional health, first aid care and vital statistics. All of these courses prepared me for a career in caring for patients.
After graduation from Westwood in 2008, I began work as a Dietary Aide at Foundry's Fitness Center.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to be applying for the open position of Systems Analyst at Crossover Software. The prospect of putting my problem-solving abilities, skills at analyzing data and knowledge of computer networking to use at your organization presents me with an incredible opportunity for personal growth. Since I am already motivated to work diligently and creatively in this role, I believe that I can be relied on to complete projects on time and do the very best work that I am capable of doing as a member of the IT team at Crossover.
Being a Systems Analyst requires a specific collection of talents that combine programming proficiency and systematic intelligence with business and interpersonal skills. My previous work history shows that I have strengths in all of these areas. In the past, I worked as a Programmer and Network Technician for Centurion Computing Solutions. This job gave me an extremely broad base of technical knowledge that covered programming in multiple languages, server administration and regular interaction with customers wherein I helped them to resolve their technical issues.
From there, I moved on to become a Systems Analyst at Centurion. This job meshed perfectly with my analytical acumen, my love of intellectual challenges, my data-driven bent and my sincere desire to help out customers and business associates. I began to take on a more management-oriented role there, meeting with clients, making note of their concerns, analyzing the performance of their businesses and offering to create tailor-made software solutions for them that would improve their bottom lines. From there, I would lead a team of developers to create whatever the client needed and note clients' feedback. On average, my work has contributed to increasing the annual revenue of client businesses by more than 12%.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. To lend my skills to the excellent IT team at Crossover would be an extraordinary honor. I pride myself on always doing the past possible job of which I am capable, and I am sure that working with the excellent developers and business professionals at Crossover will only bring the best out of me.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I want to express my excitement in applying for the Assistant Manager position at Crossover Clothing. After having spent 10 years in the clothing retail industry, the last four of which were at the Assistant Manager level, I believe that the role of an Assistant Manager is to come up with ways to solve problems as well as support the Manager in the overall plan that they have. I loved helping customers find exactly what they needed when I was an entry-level employee, and my zeal for helping people has extended to assisting new entry-level employees find their passion for giving customers a great experience, too.
In my previous role as an assistant manager at Innovation Clothing Outlet, I helped the manager lead more than 100 employees over the span of four years. In that time, one of our major initiatives was revamping the training process. Our goal was to cross-train everyone on registers and at least one department on the sales floor. Scheduling had become one of the major struggles because employees on the sales floor didn't know how to run the registers. By training new hires within the first month of their employment on how to work the point-of-sales stations, we were able to cut labor costs by 23%.
I believe that teamwork is of paramount importance and that communication should extend between shifts. That's why, with my manager's help, I implemented a communication log so that management and staff could tell each other about issues that arose throughout the day.
I'm very happy to have the opportunity to apply for the Assistant Manager position at Crossover Clothing, and I want to thank you for taking the time to consider me for the position. Continual professional development is important to me, and I will make every effort to learn from the Manager as well as share the knowledge that I've gained through experience to employees who are new to the industry.

Please accept my cover letter and resume as consideration for your open Waitress position at The Foundry Restaurant. I fulfill the requirements in the ad that state you need a Waitress who is personable, reliable, outgoing and calm under pressure. Furthermore, I fit the requirement that applicants must have two years of fine-dining experience.
In total, I have three years of experience in the food and beverage industry. During my two years at local upscale restaurant Innovation, I gained experience in all aspects of fine dining. I learned how to adapt to the varying needs of guests, especially when it came to special requests. In addition to standard server practices, including explaining the specials and reviewing any dietary requirements, I commonly upsold desserts and drinks, resulting in a monthly revenue increase of $1,500 last year. I also practiced proper cash and credit card handling procedures, performing all these tasks according to the restaurant's timeline.
Prior to working at an upscale restaurant, I spent a year at a fast-casual restaurant as a Waitress. Therefore, I have seen the different paces restaurants require. At this point in my career, I am looking to work for a restaurant inside a hotel as this will round out my background. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in hospitality and hotel management at St. Helena University. I expect to complete my degree in December 2020.
I have enclosed my resume for your review. I look forward to speaking to you soon and further explaining why I want to join The Foundry Restaurant as a Waitress. Thank you for taking the time to read my resume and cover letter.
Sincerely,
Annalise Sinclair","The Foundry Restaurant is looking for a Waitress who is personable, reliable, outgoing and calm under pressure.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am pleased to apply for the position of Structural Engineer at Flagship Engineering. I take pride in being precise, rigorous, careful and conscientious in all that I do. My analytical skills, my penchant for being systematic and the ease with which I can do math in my head are extremely useful qualities to have in an engineer, and they are qualities that I think would make me a valuable member of the engineering team over at Flagship.
In my career as a Structural Engineer, I have acquired an extensive knowledge of the physical and load-bearing properties of major construction materials like wood, concrete, masonry and steel. My education in engineering at Clearwater University provided me with rigorous training in physics, mathematics and engineering principles. I am also extremely proficient in the use of computer-aided design and modeling software like AutoCAD and SOLIDWORKS, which can be extraordinary aids in the design process.
Previously, I worked as a Structural Engineer for Centurion Engineering. While I was there, I worked on more than 200 projects, amounting to more than $26 million in revenue, that were contracted out to the firm, giving me a broad set of experiences on which to draw when designing buildings, bridges, dams or other major structures. I always make it a point to have every last detail of the relevant building codes in the area in which I'm working memorized so that everything goes off without a hitch during construction. Collaborating with other engineers â€” comparing and critiquing one another's design plans, subdividing engineering tasks and so on â€” is extremely important to getting the best final product possible, and I would be well-equipped to do this as a member of your team.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to proceeding with the hiring process and being able to contribute to your organization to the absolute best of my ability.
Sincerely,
Jensen Pope","The candidate should have a strong knowledge of physical and load-bearing properties of construction materials, as well as experience in designing and modeling with software like AutoCAD and SOLIDWORKS.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to take this opportunity to offer additional relevant information to go alongside my job application for the Sales Engineer position with Innovation Advertising. I am a trained business analyst with experience in the sales sector where I developed outstanding budgeting, financing and negotiating skills. My former roles in the spheres of sales forecasting helped me polish supplementary talents, which are mostly intangible in nature, that align well with your long-term objectives at Innovation Advertising.
I graduated from Westwood University and spent multiple years working as the regional sales director and engineer for Centurion Medical. Our practice in the field of medical instruments enabled me to learn the ins and outs of proper negotiating, contract-drafting procedures and long-term dealings. I also used this time to become highly skilled with budgeting and optimized my accounting skills to help predict sales more accurately.
I am someone who is very passionate about improving inter-company cohesion by meeting deadlines and surpassing expectations. By keeping all my engineered sales within a 2% margin of the annual budgets, I put my former employer in a position to apply for better financing and save over $15,000 in interest costs per year. I further led the dialog between the entity and multiple large clients that resulted in eight long-term contracts valued at $5.2 million over a three-year period.
I would like to thank you for taking the time to review my application. I truly appreciate the effort and consideration given to me. As the hiring process moves towards its final stages, I look forward to any additional questions that you may have for me. I am also open to attending in-person meetings where I would be able to discuss some of my expectations for the role while answering your follow-up inquiries.

I'm excited to apply for the Help Desk position at Centurion Medical.

I'm ready to use my skills and experience on the Help Desk team at Centurion Medical where I can grow at an industry-leading medical company.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am delighted to apply for the Accounting Assistant position at Flagship Engineering. The opportunity to potentially work for your company, which has been recognized as the quickest-growing operator in the field of civil engineering, excites me as I continue to seek new accounting challenges. As someone who has spent multiple years in public practice, I possess an in-depth understanding of the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as well as the basics of internal auditing. I believe that my knowledge would match this job opening very well.
During my previous roles with companies such as Crossover Software and Foundry Marketing, I worked as the Accounting Assistant to the CFO and lead internal auditor, respectively. These experiences gave me an outstanding perspective on the fruitful implementation of new accounting software and consistent adherence to the rapidly evolving laws of business. I also developed outstanding communication skills that let me work with practically anyone and helped me coordinate dozens of projects that had a 95% combined rate of timely completion.
I would also like to stress my ability to support accounting seniors by completing all of the delegated tasks effectively. With over 400 hours of continuing education, I have an excellent understanding of potential areas of practice where businesses may face issues. This allowed me to identify and proactively resolve countless issues that reduced my prior employer's need to halt accounting operations by 45%. I further thrive in public speaking engagements organized at professional workplace settings.
I am grateful for the opportunity to receive your consideration for the Accounting Assistant position. Thank you for the time spent reviewing my application. I look forward to any subsequent interaction where I will be more than happy to discuss the specific nature of my prior experiences in more detail.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to have the opportunity to apply for the position of Executive at Crossover Software. I began my career as a software developer, so I understand the needs, culture and work environment of software firms like Crossover. However, I was able to carry over the same kind of problem-solving acuity that served me so well in the development field into a managerial role. I believe that my intimate familiarity with the software world combined with my communication skills, charisma and organizational abilities make me an excellent fit for this position.
I've always had a knack for numbers and solving problems. The more difficult the problem, the more driven I am to solve it. It seems natural that such inclinations would have led me to initially become a software developer. Working at Flagship Network Technologies gave free reign to my penchant for systematic thinking that is vital to a leadership role.
As my career progressed, I began to be put into more senior roles, eventually leading and coordinating teams of software developers on large-scale projects. Such work gave me my first taste of what it was to be a manager, and I found that I enjoyed it. I had the interpersonal communication skills necessary to inspire trust and the kind of vision and leadership qualities that earned me respect from those working beneath me. Under my direction, my development team was able to roll out new code more quickly, performing all necessary debugging and maintenance operations, and we were ultimately able to submit work to clients 20% faster than before.
I thank you for your time in examining me for this role. With one foot in the development world and the other foot in the management world, I believe that I have the unique combination of talents and experiences that make for an excellent executive at Crossover. It would be an honor to join the Crossover team and help push your wonderful company to new heights.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I recently moved into the city in part because of Centurion Medical's stellar reputation. I have worked as a Medical Office Manager for the past five years and would like the opportunity to talk to you about your open position. I have a bachelor's degree in business management, and I am currently working on my master's degree.
I have worked in health care for nearly 20 years. Most of that that time was spent in small physician offices, often for only one doctor. There were times when I did every job other than actually seeing the patient, but I have also managed up to five other employees. My ability to keep the offices running smoothly allowed my doctors to focus on caring for patients.
Keeping things organized comes second nature to me. I did billing and coding for two of the offices I worked in, so I have dealt with pharmacies, insurance companies, drug sales representatives and family members of our patients. I have been fortunate to work with people who taught me something with each visit. By moving into the city after living in a small town for so long, I look forward to bringing small-town charm with me to help keep patients calm in a hectic world.
The experiences I bring with me would complement all that I would learn as an employee of Centurion Medical. I am open to learning new things and have 20 years of health care experience behind me. I would like to offer my services for the foreseeable future and look forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to apply for your latest opening for a Payroll Clerk at Crossover Software. Getting the chance to seek employment with your company is certainly one of the highlights of my career, as I have followed all of your accomplishments since inception. As one of the leaders in the spheres of information technology, Crossover Software was very active in the local community of St. Helena University, where I completed my education.
During my four-year experience with Foundry Marketing, which is the last employer that I worked for, I managed the company's payroll system, ran constant updates, and facilitated smooth integration with other departments. I also helped switch to the middleman provider of direct deposit services that saved our business 29% in overhead costs over a two-year period. I further helped diagnose and resolve a weekly average of eight problems reported by employees from all sectors. Doing so allowed me to improve my critical thinking and professional communication skills.
Some of my priorities include fixing system errors within the payroll department's software, implementing more efficient methods of compensation, and approving employees' tax-related documentation. Additionally, I spent over 45 hours delivering weekly seminars covering the basic concepts of successful payroll integration to senior-level managers and multiple executives. Doing so helped me polish my public speaking skills and turn formal presentation into one of my strengths and passions.
Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to work for your organization. I believe that my skills can be an outstanding asset to Crossover Software. As you continue the hiring process, I look forward to communicating with you directly and going into more details about the Payroll Clerk position as well as some of my personal goals.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It's an honor to apply for the position of Prosecutor with the Centurion County District Attorney's Office. As a longtime attorney, I am passionate about the rule of law and helping to ensure that justice is served for both the victims and the accused in our community.
My career path has taken me from answering phones at Flagship Partners Law Office while in law school and clerking for an area defense attorney to landing a Junior Prosecutor position in Foundry County, a position in which I served for the last six years with an average conviction rate of 70% across all cases brought before the court. In addition to being the lead prosecutor on low-level felonies and the majority of misdemeanors, I also assisted the DA with preparing for high-profile trials, including three murders and one arson. Those defendants were all convicted.
In addition to my prosecutorial work, I have spent time interning with our state's legal aid foundation, and I became interested in the Innocence Project while in law school and still devote time to help file motions or prepare briefs. Due to my work on behalf of defendants, I think that I am even more dedicated to justice. I want to be sure that the innocent are not deprived of their rights and that the guilty receive a just sentence. That sense of duty and respect for the law is what drives my work as an attorney.
Thank you for considering me as a candidate for Prosecutor with the CCDA. I believe that my blend of skills from both sides of the bench provides me with passion and a point of view that's desperately needed in our judicial system. I look forward to learning more about how I can be of service to the community.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to introduce myself. My name is Hector Silva, and I have lived here for 25 years. I know the city well and have been honored to serve as a Paramedic for a number of small companies. I have seen this town grow as well as its need for good medical help. That's where I come in.
I started as an EMT when I first graduated from high school. I wanted to be certified in something that mattered while I figured my life out. That was 10 years ago. Since then I have taken more training and became a paramedic five years ago. Training never stops, and that's one of the things that makes me love this job so much. I know I am helping my patients with some of the newest medical information around.
One of the areas of being a Paramedic that is so important is that we work in conjunction with the firehouses and the police department. When one of us needs help, someone is there. Fire and police personnel are often cross-trained in emergency medicine, which goes a long way when we are called to a motor vehicle accident or a house on fire. Sometimes we are all spread thin, and it takes every one of us to get the job done to save as many lives as possible.
At this point in my career, I am looking for stability. I know I may need to step down from all the hardcore action one of these days in the future. I might consider hospital administration down the road. Centurion Medical has such a strong reputation that I thought it would be a good place to work. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Hector Silva","The ideal candidate for this position will have at least 10 years of experience in emergency medicine, with at least 5 years as a certified paramedic.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I was thrilled to discover that Centurion Medical is now offering home health. I have worked as a Home Health Aide for the past six years for an independent employer, but I would love to transfer my skills to your corporation. My grandmother was hospitalized at Centurion Hospital, and she received excellent care there. I would be proud to be a staff member of this award-winning facility.
My first experience caring for the elderly came about when I was only 10 years old. My paternal grandfather had a stroke and lived with my family for three years. It was my job to help Grandpa eat. I loved having those moments with him, and it was then that I knew I wanted to help people as a career someday. A few years later, my mother gave birth to a daughter with cerebral palsy. I was involved with her care from the very beginning.
I still desire to someday become a nurse to help people even more. Right now, I am taking night classes while working to become a Home Health Aide. For three years, I have worked a variety of shifts while caring for both the elderly and the mentally and physically disabled. I have a gift for treating these patients with compassionate care. I believe it's important that we never forget the humanity that we all share.
Thank you for reviewing my application. My empathetic nature, as well as my years of experience, makes me a perfect fit for this job. I can handle everything from bedpans to feeding tubes with no oversight. I am committed to helping patients mentally, physically and emotionally. I'm excited to visit with you about the types of patients you have who require home health.

As someone who additionally values the opportunity to grow and acquire new expertise, I would be thrilled to join your team as I do my best to serve your clients effectively.

Whilst leveraging my financial knowledge, I constantly sought to improve my intangible skills such as leadership and communication. This allowed me to successfully operate on countless teams.
I consider myself to be a client-driven financial expert who navigates the lending processes in a way that maximizes people's ability to make timely payments. One of my most pertinent capabilities, which I believe would align well with this role at Flagship Engineering, is finding income verifications and confirming the validity of clients' applications. I was able to take full advantage of the said skill in the past and help my last employer uncover between 20 and 30 invalid documents per year. This led to a 15% decrease in fraudulent lending and contributed to notable savings on corporate insurance policies.

Additionally, I documented my observations in patients' electronic medical records with 98% accuracy.

I'm capable of overseeing the nutritional needs of people who are dealing with a variety of conditions. My training has taught me how to oversee the needs of large groups in an organized and efficient manner.
I studied health and nutritional science at St. Helena University. After graduating, I went on to work with a variety of private clients who were seeking to get their health back on track. Through doing this work, I was exposed to people who had a wide scope of needs, and I was able to deepen my knowledge of how to work with certain conditions, like diabetes.
After spending a couple of years working with private clients, I transitioned to working at a nursing home. It was here that I gained my experience with managing and overseeing the needs of large groups. I maintained organized charts pertaining to dietary restrictions and thoroughly kept track of the health-related changes that occurred by working with medical staff so that meal plans could be altered as necessary. As a result, there was a 3% decrease in allergy incidents within a year of me working at the nursing home.

I'm excited to apply for the Technical Writer position at Flagship Engineering. As an organized and detail-oriented individual, I have a proven record of meeting deadlines and maintaining the communication chain to ensure that projects run smoothly. With my varied skills and experience, I believe I would be a great fit for this position.
At Crossover Software, I worked with the software engineers to plan, develop and write manuals for the latest software projects. I focused primarily on document changes to ensure that the electronic documentation was edited to reflect each of the software updates. I coordinated projects with the executive team to ensure that every task was completed and meetings went smoothly. As a result, I was able to improve the turnaround time by an average of three days for each update.
I adapt well to the changing needs of business and can anticipate changes ahead of time to ensure smooth transitions between updates. I enjoy researching new document management systems to streamline the revision process.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to be applying for the position of Manufacturing Engineer at Flagship Engineering. In my work, I like to combine a creative streak with a continuous drive for leanness and efficiency. I think that this combination makes me a perfect fit for this open position because I am always striving to find ways to optimize the performance of some existing industrial or manufacturing process and am not afraid to think in bold and original ways to do it. I am naturally a very systematic thinker and can always be relied upon to be precise and rigorous in every maintenance check or proposal for improvement.
Ever since I began my career in engineering at Centurion Industries, I have always remained aware that even the tiniest miscalculation could wreak havoc on an organization's established manufacturing processes. My education in mechanical engineering at Westwood University provided me with a strong foundation in physics and mathematics. While there, I learned to perform complex and important calculations quickly and accurately in my head â€” an ability that has always served me well in a pinch.
Still, I take care to check every calculation and supplement all design sketches with models created with computer-aided design software, like AutoCAD or SOLIDWORKS. In this way, I have been able to visualize what devices meant to improve manufacturing efficiency might look like and how they might function before actually implementing them. While at Centurion, the proposals that my team and I submitted ended up increasing steel production by 8% per annum.
I earnestly thank you for your time and attention in considering me for this position. Joining the tight-knit and talented community of engineers and technicians at Flagship would be a wonderful opportunity to develop my talents and do what I love to do. As we move forward in the hiring process, I hope to be able to show you that I belong on the team.

Of all my personal qualities, I believe that this is the one which makes me most suited to this role, as it means that I will take great care in doing those things which are most important for a Pharmacist to do â€” organizing and periodically replenishing drug stocks, making sure that patients get the right medications in the right doses and so on.
However, I combine this disposition of mine with a deep knowledge of medicine, biochemistry and toxicology, which was imparted to me during my time as a student at St. Helena Medical School where I got my BPharm and MPharm degrees. This means that I can be trusted to easily answer a wide range of questions that patients might have about their medication â€” questions about dosages, how often to take them, possible side effects and so on. I'm also quick with numbers and therefore able to give patients their medications in the correct doses reliably and efficiently.
I have some experience working alongside experienced Pharmacists and picking up the tricks of the trade from them. This experience formed an important part of my pharmacological education. I learned to develop a meticulous attention to detail and to always treat customers kindly, courteously and with respect. It would be an honor to begin what I hope will be the start of a productive and fruitful career here at Clearwater.
I extend my gratitude to you for your time and attention in considering me for this position. I take pride in the simple but important act of performing honest service. What more crucial service is there than making sure that people's health needs are met and their ailments treated? As we move on with the hiring process, therefore, I look forward to being able to demonstrate my skills and commitment to serving patients as a member of the Clearwater staff.

I look forward to the opportunity to use my ministry skills to further the mission and vision of Flagship Church.
During my present tenure at Innovation Church, our average weekly attendance has grown from 450 to 800. I spearheaded this 43% increase by implementing needs-based community outreach programs, delivering creative weekend messages and creating a series of introductory classes for potential new members. Within the first year of the membership courses, 81% of participants choose to place their membership at Innovation Church. In addition, 45% of them chose to profess their faith through baptism for the first time.
I value servant leadership, and I believe that guiding teams well begins with responding to the needs of others. At Innovation Church, I have overseen five full-time staff members as well as numerous volunteer groups. As an organized and efficient administrator, I maintain schedules and rotations to ensure that each person on the team has ample opportunities for both service and rest. My thoughtful approach to time management has led to a 63% increase in volunteer satisfaction and an 81% increase in staff retention over the last three years.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It is a tremendous honor for me to be able to apply to become an Intelligence Analyst at Centurion Security. Investigating and examining intelligence and training operatives to assist and serve the US government, as private contractors like Centurion do, is one of the greatest privileges. With my extremely data-oriented mentality, strong analytical skills and personal integrity, I believe that I can be an asset to both Centurion and the intelligence community it regularly works with. In my opinion, my most precious skills are my perceptiveness and ability to read body language and detect deception â€” a crucial skill for all of those looking to recruit additional agents â€” train them and assign them to duties applicable to their talents.
I have extensive experience in the fields of security, law enforcement and data analysis. I worked as a private investigator for Flagship Security, familiarizing myself with open-source intelligence-gathering techniques and interviewing potential suspects in the course of my work. Later, I became a police officer and enjoyed a distinguished 10-year career before deciding to apply the knowledge and experience I gained in the intelligence-gathering sector towards becoming an Intelligence Analyst for Crossover Security Solutions.
While at Crossover, I picked up valuable computer programming and quantitative data analysis skills that improved the efficiency at which I could gather, collate and sift through open-source intelligence. My work providing and analyzing potentially valuable intelligence for the Department of Defense and the CIA has been among the proudest of my life.
I thank you graciously for your time, kindness and attention for considering me for this all-important position. It is an honor to be able to use my intelligence, experience and facility with quantitative data to serve my country through the private sector. As we move through the hiring process, I am prepared to demonstrate the full extent of my talents and to allow them to be used wherever I can be of most value.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I was a patient at Centurion Medical when I injured my shoulder playing football in high school. The superb care I received inspired me to go to school to become a Physical Therapist Assistant. Imagine my delight when, fresh out of college, I saw an opening to apply at the very institution that inspired my career choice. As a recent graduate with an associate's degree, I have a fresh sense of optimism and enthusiasm for my new career and am eager to apply everything I have learned.
My first experience with physical therapy was when I injured my rotator cuff playing high school football. I had to undergo surgery and physical therapy for the first time in my life. It was a scary and devastating time for me as I hoped to play football in college. The Physical Therapist Assistants at Centurion Medical helped heal me both physically and mentally. They understood the emotions I was going through, and as we worked on the exercises to restore my physical health, we had many conversations that restored my mental health. I feel strongly that a Physical Therapy Assistant must be cognizant of a patient's mental and emotional health in addition to their physical well-being.
My plan is to continue my schooling to become a physical therapist. I want to be an assistant first to gain some valuable field experience while I continue to attend night school and complete some online courses. While in school, I was an active member of a volunteer group and spent many evenings and weekends cheering up the elderly in nursing homes. I also volunteered with the local high school Special Olympics team. I believe that my experiences with the elderly and disabled will be a great help in my job as a Physical Therapist Assistant.
Thank you for considering my application. I'm looking forward to visiting with you in person about my zeal for physical therapy and my fondness for Centurion Medical. I'm committed to helping each and every patient as I have been helped.

Dear Hiring Manager,
Please accept my cover letter and attached resume as consideration for your opening for a Sous Chef at Innovation Bistro. I have 10 years of experience running a kitchen in the absence of an executive chef along with quick food prep skills. My dedication to improving food quality and restaurant operations will become an asset to Innovation Bistro. In return, I look forward to the opportunity to experiment with Italian-fusion cuisine and diversify my portfolio of culinary skills.
I have worked in the food and beverage industry for more than 15 years. I currently serve as the Sous Chef at an Italian restaurant that caters to more than 150 patrons on a daily basis. Working in the kitchen requires patience, problem-solving skills, leadership abilities and the respect of the staff â€” all of which I have honed during my time here.
At my current position, I continue to contribute to the restaurant's financial success by refining the menu, experimenting with new recipes and using seasonal ingredients. I also developed a survey for guests to take to help the restaurant decide which dishes should remain on the menu. These results, along with analyzing the restaurant's sales figures, contributed to a boost in appetizer and entrÃ©e sales by 95%. Taking these steps also helped the restaurant reduce its food budget and waste, allowing it to give more raises to its servers and other deserving employees.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident that my skills as a Sous Chef â€” and my ability to analyze profit margins â€“ will help Innovation Bistro expand its client base.

There's a new flux of projects being handled by your company, and I look forward to learning more about how I can lead your projects for an outstanding quality standard.
Westwood University gave me a professional overview of various construction processes. Via heavy, highway and building construction, I was able to garner the right set of skills for most labor projects pursued today. I've even improved my ability to speak Spanish. Being organized and responsive are important assets to have at a construction site. The manual labor jobs that I've had allowed me to work with soft, light and heavy materials. I also operate heavy machinery. With me, you'll have a smart machine operator with a clear grasp of the delicate touch required. I'm very decisive when I'm using backhoes and dozers.

Every laborer has to adjust to ongoing regulations. I know that the construction industry becomes more complex each year and that keeping up with new training and education is important. I believe that we can manage the growing dynamic together. I bring you my experience in masonry, hydraulics, carpentry, plumbing, land grading and concrete molding.

When working on my Ph.D. at Clearwater University, I collaborated with Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson and his team of researchers on ways to apply X-ray crystallography to the creation of barriers better able to protect people from high-energy radiation. Working with this team taught me valuable lessons about proper lab work and how to bounce ideas off fellow researchers in ways that would produce creative tension. Doing this also sparked a passionate interest in energy that has never left me.
After completing my Ph.D., I would start work at Foundry Petrochemical Labs and throw myself fully into finding ways to extract as much energy per unit of hydrocarbons as possible. After years of exhaustive research and testing, I was able to harness 15% more energy from petroleum than had previously been possible. My fellow chemists at Foundry and I would publish articles in the  detailing our findings. I would love to apply my skills and experience to help Centurion Industries achieve similar successes.
Thank you for your time and consideration. It would be an honor for me to be able to apply my skills and talents at Centurion Industries to push the boundaries of what is currently technologically possible. To enjoy the privilege of working with the world-class research staff and state-of-the-art equipment at Centurion's labs would also be of inestimable value to me as a matter of personal growth. I look forward to learning more about the open Chemist position you have at Centurion and am fascinated by the prospect of joining your elite team.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to be applying for the opportunity to become a Translator at Foundry Marketing and be of assistance to your company when communicating with international clients. I believe that with my somewhat peculiar background and collection of skills, I can be of great use to Foundry in this role. Growing up, I traveled around the world with my parents and visited more than a dozen countries. This, combined with a natural love of and talent for languages, allowed me to pick up and attain fluency in quite a number of them. I would develop and expand this ability even further throughout my education and working career. The nuances of language fascinate me, and to be able to have work that allows me to explore them and marinate in them each and every day would be a true pleasure and a privilege.
I completed received a bachelor's degree in Foreign Languages from Clearwater University, specializing in French and Russian. Beyond this, I can also speak fluent Spanish and German. Indeed, I regularly read books in all these languages to maintain my fluency in them. I am also able to read in Italian, Dutch, Polish and Ukrainian. I believe that I have a decent conversational grasp of these latter four languages.
I am also able to speak clearly and effectively and write tight and readable prose. During summers as a college student, I worked as an intern at the United Nations, translating political speeches and legal documents from one language to another. I would also assist immigrants and foreign-speaking clients at Centurion Legal Group. With this experience, I can be relied on to translate technical documents like corporate earnings reports, instruction manuals for products and forecasts of upcoming market trends. I can also translate more colloquial material, like staff emails and translate back and forth between Foundry's employees and visiting foreign clients.
I am deeply grateful for your time and attention in considering me for this position.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm genuinely excited to be applying for the position of CEO at Centurion Medical. You'll find in me a driven, assertive executive devoted to achieving success. I demand the very best from myself in all things that I do. This allows me to demand the same from my staff. Confidence and belief in oneself are extremely important qualities in a leader, and I believe that I possess them in sufficient quantity to be an excellent CEO for your organization. Of course, I also have a strong and ever-present sense of personal responsibility that extends not only to the shareholders of any business entrusted to me but also to its employees and customers. The prospect of leading this superb company into a new future offers an irresistibly attractive challenge.
I am different from the typical prospective CEO in a way that makes me especially well-suited to run a company like Centurion Medical: I have a medical degree. I earned my M.D. from Clearwater University, so I have an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of medicine and medical technology. This would make me uniquely sensitive to the needs and concerns of the staff at Centurion Medical.
After earning my medical degree, I decided to become an entrepreneur. I've started several companies of my own and sold them for a substantial profit. This led to an offer to head one of the largest medical corporations west of the Mississippi River. When I assumed control, it had been in the red for the past consecutive five years. After one year of my leadership, we turned a profit of 28%, and that increased by at least 12% annually until I resigned three years later.
My experience has taught me that a CEO should be far more than merely the boss. Every successful company is actually a collection of committed and talented individuals who are fulfilled by their work and inspired by their leadership. If were granted the honor of leading Centurion Medical, I would be working for you as much as you would be working for me, and I'd do everything in my power to earn that admiration while serving as your CEO.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I recently moved to town and was pleased to see an opening at Flagship High School for a Guidance Counselor. I completed my master's degree at St. Helena University and have spent the last three years working as an assistant counselor. I'm ready and eager to assume the full responsibility of Guidance Counselor. My personal goal is to ensure that every student has the skills needed to graduate high school and enter higher education or the working world.
As an assistant counselor, I provided many hours of both individual and group counseling. I managed a team of three assistants who helped provide services to all of our students. My niche group was working with students who were applying to college but had no financial assistance from their parents. The average scholarship amount awarded to the students I helped was $4,500. This was in addition to the federal grants I helped them apply to. I find great satisfaction in helping students achieve their dreams.
On the counseling side, I worked with a group of students who had been affected by deaths in their close family. The deaths varied from siblings to parents and high school friends. The students ranged greatly in their abilities to handle their grief, and I worked both individually and in groups to help the students through these trying times. Of the students I worked with directly, we achieved a 97% graduation rate.
I'm excited to use the education and experience I have gained these past three years to help students at Flagship High School. As a Guidance Counselor, I plan to create dedicated teams to help different groups of students. Many students need both individual and group counseling, but I strive to look past stereotypes and work with each student as an individual. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to learning more about the educational structure in your school and how I can best assist the learning process for each student.

I am excited to be applying for the open Actuary position at Innovation Insurance Corporation. With my strongly data-driven mentality and deep knowledge of probability and statistics, I believe I would be an excellent fit for this role. A fascination with games of chance that emerged early in my life eventually morphed into an interest in risk and its nature as I grew older. My strong mathematical abilities and analytical skills thus make me a natural fit as an actuary. I believe that I can prove to you that hiring me to assess the risks in Innovation's insurance pool is a no-risk proposition.
My formal education has included heavy training in mathematics, culminating in a Masters of Science from Westwood University. From there, I went on to work at financial firms like Foundry Securities Group, analyzing and attempting to predict market trends. The reports that I prepared were always careful, precise, rigorous, full of conservative prognostications and, perhaps most importantly, easy to read and digest. My track record was also accurate as following my advice led our clients to increase their profits by an average of 10%.
This experience in the financial sector greatly honed my ability to digest, analyze and distill large reams of data. Equally important was the experience of dealing with financial markets. Given the significant extent to which insurance companies like Innovation make investments and how crucial those investments are to the success of their business models, I believe that this experience would make me an especially worthwhile addition to your team.

I know how to prep ingredients, cook all of them to their required specifications, and then assemble the meals while following your head chef's instructions.
I currently work as a Line Cook at the Foundry Diner. My duties include cooking, inspecting and testing meals for quality before they go out to guests, and handling tickets as servers bring them to the line. I work in a team of eight kitchen members; we make and serve meals for up to 180 patrons at each meal period. To ensure the kitchen staff could continue to keep the required pace, I worked with our sous-chef to refine our food prep and cooking procedures. This allowed us to reduce the overall time to cook each meal by 15%.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to be applying for the Retail Manager position at Flagship Clothing Company. With remarkable interpersonal skills and the ability to lead others, I am an individual who excels at building a team of motivated and hardworking associates. I am excited at the possibility of taking Flagship Clothing Company to the next level by providing my skills as a Retail Manager in the fashion industry.
During my previous role at Crossover Kids, I increased revenue by 50% in my first year by implementing multiple sales throughout the year. I researched the best dates to host sales and provide customers with deals before strategically designing a markdown system that drew patrons into Crossover Kids consistently over the year. I cut down our payroll expenses by 25% in three months by providing each employee with specific roles within each position. Instead of having nine associates and one supervisor per shift, I was able to reduce our staff down to four associates and two supervisors per shift.
I am people-oriented, and I understand the importance of maintaining a high level of professionalism when interacting with staff and customers. I aim to ensure accurate end-of-the-night reports by double-checking each lead's numbers before clocking out. While at Foundry Parks, a local pet supply store, I reached out to five new vendors within my first month to compare inventory quotes. I reduced our cost of merchandise by 35% by partnering with a local vendor that offered more affordable products.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I was so pleased to see your posting for the Store Manager position at Centurion Foods. I love working with employees to help them grow within team environments, and I love creating positive experiences for customers. As someone who is highly experienced with hiring, training and creating environments in which employees can thrive, I'm excited to help Centurion Foods grow that type of atmosphere. I also have experience with creating and maintaining store layouts that make the shopping experience easier and more pleasant for customers. By combining my previous experience at other stores with Centurion Foods systems and philosophies, I can help the store continue to financially grow and be a pillar of the community for employees and customers.
We all know that turnover is expensive, so I work on increasing job satisfaction to retain current employees. In my previous position at Foundry Natural Foods, I led over 35 employees with an overall turnover rate of less than 50% in the final year that I was the manager there. I also know that repeat business is the cornerstone to businesses that stand the test of time. There's always plenty of competition, so I refined the training process so that customers always received efficient and personable service.
I'm very aware that grocery stores need to keep their prices competitive to continually draw new customers in and retain the ones they already have. Because of this, we instituted a price-matching structure so that if a customer found an advertisement for the same product at another store for a lower price we would match that price.
Thank you for your time and for considering me for the Store Manager position at Centurion Foods. Constantly expanding my set of skills is of utmost importance to me, so I would be very glad to have the opportunity to continue to learn at a slightly different type of grocery store. I will also be very happy to bring the knowledge and skills that I learned in my previous jobs to Centurion Foods.

One of your recent hires, Jensen Pope, referred me to the open Host position at The Flagship Bar and Grill. I recently moved to the suburbs near your establishment. I am used to working in a fast-paced lounge environment, and my skills will nicely transfer over to the bar/lounge area at The Flagship Bar and Grill.
In my last position, I worked as a Host for an upscale bar/lounge in the downtown area called Innovation. I answered telephone inquiries, made reservations, staffed the podium and escorted our guests to the tables in the lounge area. When needed, I assisted servers in delivering items to the lounge tables, and when at capacity, I helped clear tables so that we could quickly turn them over to accommodate waiting patrons. During my three years there, I became known for my versatility, often filling in for lounge servers when they needed to help staff the main dining area. The lounge was mystery shopped when I worked there, and my manager gave me a raise based on the scores and feedback received in those evaluations. Additionally, my manager asked me to help plan theme nights and market new ways to reach customers on our slowest night. Our efforts worked â€“ we increased revenue by 20%.
I have an associate's degree in business administration; the tools I learned in my courses helped me at my previous job. I am confident that my hosting skills, along with my desire to learn and grow, will make me an asset to The Flagship Bar and Grill. In the next few years, I plan to continue my education in restaurant management.

I am also a long-time supporter of your company's on-going partnership with the Red Cross of America, and I would be thrilled to support such a positive cause by getting involved in any way possible.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am ecstatic to begin my career as a Mental Health Counselor for Centurion Medical. My dissertation during my master's degree at St. Helena University was focused on mental health recovery before, during and after an illness or disease. As a Mental Health Counselor for Centurion Medical, I will help individuals regain mental stability and control in their lives during a time when hope may seem lost and their entire way of life may be required to change.
During my mandatory clinic hours studying at St. Helena University, I was able to observe and to analyze the ways people struggle with illness and disease in all aspects of their lives, from their home lives to their work lives. My research concentrated on the ineffective methodologies individuals naturally attempt to implement as coping mechanisms. I would then work with patients to incorporate more effective methodologies to restore their mental health. In roughly 65% of the cases, patients healed up to twice as quickly as patients who did not receive any mental health counseling.
It was also revealed that the mental health and stability of the children of patients with illnesses and diseases improved when parents who were receiving treatment sought help from a Mental Health Counselor. Children were better able to adjust to the changes in their lives and their new routines in a positive manner when the parent was receiving mental health care. They also reported improvements at school by 24%.
Thank you for your consideration and time. After working with patients directly to complete my dissertation, my passion for improving the mental health of patients going through treatment for illnesses and diseases has only become stronger. Together, I believe we can help patients overcome all obstacles they face, both physically and mentally. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

As I'm currently working on my Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Clearwater, this role will provide me with valuable experience that will ready me to become a full professor once my thesis is complete. I am not only a diligent researcher in my chosen field, but I'm also able to use that diligence to prepare lesson plans for full professors at the university and assist them by grading papers, answering students' questions during office hours and helping to teach students.
After finishing my B.S. and M.S. in mathematical physics at Clearwater, my sterling academic record earned me immediate acceptance into the Ph.D. program. Since I want to devote myself to investigating the mysteries of the physical universe and inspiring students with the same awe and wonder that I feel for these things, I would like to become an Adjunct Faculty member as I work on my Ph.D. I already have some teaching experience that I picked up as a teaching assistant while working on my master's degree. Feedback from my professors confirms that I'm able to effectively respond to students' needs, answer their questions, provide engaging and stimulating lectures and clearly explain difficult concepts to them. My student evaluations have been excellent, and in one of my recent classes, 86% of my students earned an A on their final exam.
Beyond this, I also assist professors in creating lesson plans and offer suggestions on how best to make sure that students can understand the course material. I grade exams and homework assignments efficiently and make sure that all work is completed on time.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. My experience as a student at Clearwater University has been enormously rewarding, and I'm excited to have the chance to give back and join the faculty that's lit such a strong passion for learning in me. It is a privilege I hope to have as we move forward in the hiring process.
Sincerely,
Jensen Pope","The candidate should be able to effectively respond to students' needs, answer their questions, provide engaging and stimulating lectures and clearly explain difficult concepts to them.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am happy to be applying for the Accounting Clerk position at Centurion Medical. As an alum of St. Helena University's accounting program, working as a clerk will allow me to fully utilize my technical knowledge. Over the past few years, I accumulated important experience in the spheres of public practice, where I learned how to implement new taxation software, journalize entries, record unusual, one-time transactions and thrive in a fast-paced environment.
During my previous role at Crossover Software, I supported sales of information technology software by drafting contracts, keeping track of the company's financial books and posting journals to the general ledger. Doing so allowed me to learn how public corporations handle the administrative side of their practices as my team and I reduced the consistency of accounting mistakes by 43%. We additionally helped incorporate a brand-new accounting system that all employees were trained on as we worked tirelessly to diagnose and resolve 52 problems reported within the first month.
In my profession, I am dedicated to constantly learning new things and see my work as an opportunity to help the company reach its everyday and long-term objectives. By fulfilling the Accounting Clerk position, I hope to put my talents to use as I make myself indispensable to every accounting and internal audit manager. I am also prepared to help Centurion Medical upgrade its information systems as this led my prior employer to a 20% higher transaction processing rate.
I appreciate your time and consideration. As I look forward to finding out more about the Accounting Clerk position, I am equally excited to interact with Centurion Medical and gain a better understanding of your bottom-line goals and expectations.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I saw your job posting this week, and I was more than thrilled to apply because I think I would be the perfect fit for your company. Makeup and its artistry have been my passion ever since I was a young girl, and I take great pride in my craft. I started doing makeup for people when I was 13 years old. People were quite impressed with my skills, and other girls in my class started asking me to do makeup for them, so I did. In high school, I would do other girls makeup for prom and dance nights to help pay for my college tuition. I would also post makeup tutorials on YouTube on the side. Even though I have years of experience under my belt, I still stay humble and continuously work hard to sharpen my makeup application skills.
After I completed my cosmetology training program and obtained my license, I went on to take a variety of internships that taught me all about highlighting, facial contouring, lip lining and more advanced techniques such as skin exfoliation, extraction and lymphatic drainage.
After I finished my internships, I was hired by a local beauty salon in my hometown where I was able to learn more about makeup and help the women at the salon feel gorgeous. I kept a 93% satisfaction rate with my clients, worked with a variety of different skin types, helped with providing makeup and hair services to more than 20 clients a day and created beautiful and unique looks based on my own consultations with clients of various skin tones and age ranges.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about the position.

Dear Hiring Manager,
It is my pleasure to apply for the Auditor position at Flagship Engineering. As a trained accountant with a history of internal auditing, I believe that I would be a good fit for the role and an asset to your organization. My talents also include excellent communication skills that have helped me train dozens of accounting clerks and bookkeepers during my career.
I previously worked as an auditor for companies such as Centurion Medical and Crossover Software where I managed all internal accounting processes. This included reviewing all posted transactions, editing journal entries whenever necessary and coordinating external audits with independent accountants. During the past two years as the U.S. taxation laws changed, I completed over 300 hours of continuing education. Courtesy of that knowledge, I helped my former employer save over $5,000 in penalties and fees that would have been levied due to failure to report certain types of income.
I am very skilled with all accounting software as well as in-depth research that helps answer complex inquires and complete long-term projects. My experience is based on working with large teams and guiding new workers through a wide variety of auditing tasks. I also have a history of holding weekly seminars on the auditing principles that helped my former coworkers improve performance and complete tasks between 29 and 35% faster. I believe that I will be able to use my auditing experience and knowledge to help Flagship Engineering meet quarterly goals by facilitating the smooth operation of the auditing projects to which I am assigned.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited to learn more about the Auditor position as well as the expectations at Flagship Engineering. I hope to receive a chance to interact with you in person, discuss my growth objectives and demonstrate my abilities.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am thrilled to submit my application for the Social Media Specialist at Innovation Advertising. As a pioneer of the social media age, I have experience that goes back to the initial creation of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. By witnessing some of the first advertising campaigns and all subsequent changes, I have developed an understanding of the types of projects that have high rates of success versus the ones that will fail.
I am trained in the area of contemporary marketing platforms, which includes a plethora of social media websites where I utilize current trends and interest-based targeting to seek new buyers. I also helped lead a large project focused on retargeting of prior buyers for Innovation Advertising. During my time with the company, our team was able to reduce the rate of abandoned checkouts by 28% and increase the number of repeat clients by 41%. These changes contributed to an additional 6% in bottom-line revenues. All of our work prioritized sustainability and cost-saving strategies that yielded a sub-par increase in expenses for the company.
I have completed multiple training sessions of professional business communication, employee negotiation techniques, and customer conflict resolution. This allows me to interact with practically anyone and effectively determine their objectives. Due to the way that social media marketing operates, having these talents helped me reach the highest efficiency rate for advertising campaigns at Innovation Advertising where 73% of all my work resulted in a purchase. I hope to use these talents again as I help your clients advertise to their buyers in a smarter and more lucrative manner.
Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I am excited to continue interacting with your brand and get to understand your underlying expectations more. I will also be more than happy to demonstrate any of the aforementioned talents by submitting short projects or tangible deliverables from my prior engagements.

During my education at Longford Tech I studied art history, design, drawing, color theory, and painting. Throughout college, my work was selected to be in many art shows, including the TradeLot Art Show, one of the biggest shows on the West Coast. My paintings featured a wide range of subjects such as mermaids, people, sailboats, beaches, monuments, plants, and much more. My favorite element to experiment with is color. I enjoy seeing how a colorful painting can add brightness to any room. The most rewarding part of being an artist is seeing the face of the client when they see their finished order.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to learning about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I feel that the Artist position will allow me to utilize my well-practiced skills to add value to your company.
Sincerely,
Malik Rabb","The Cloud Clearwater Artist will be responsible for creating expressive and interesting pieces of art that match the needs of our clientele.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm thrilled to be applying for an LPN position on the perinatology floor of Centurion Medical. I have always needed to nurture and care for those around me, first, as the oldest daughter of the family and then as I had a family of my own. When my children reached school age, I turned my passion for care to education as a nurse. I have many years of both personal and professional experience in caring for babies.
As a new graduate of the LPN program, I first worked in a nursing home, caring for the elderly. I have spent the last three years of my nursing career on the medical/surgical floor of the hospital while I waited for an opportunity to work with babies. I loved having clinicals with the mothers and babies on the perinatal floor and relish the opportunity to be a part of this special time. As a mother of three children myself, I know firsthand how an experienced nurse can make a positive impact during the labor, delivery and postpartum periods. I have a fervent desire to help each and every woman achieve her best labor and delivery experience.
I am self-motivated and do not need a lot of oversight. Many of my supervisors have commented that I strike the right balance between professionalism and responsiveness while dealing with patients. In seven years of being an LPN, I have maintained a strong record of avoiding errors. I was an integral part of the quality control team on the med/surg floor; during this time, we managed to reduce the nosocomial infection rate from 3.5% to 1%. I will continue to use these infection control methods wherever I work. I exceed the number of continuing education credits I need each year because I have a zeal for learning and am committed to continually updating my skills and knowledge.
Thank you for considering my application. I know you have many qualified applicants at Centurion Medical, and I appreciate the chance to demonstrate my skills and commitment to the nursing profession. I know I will be a positive addition to your perinatology team.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am very interested in your position of Buyer for the gift shop at Centurion Medical. I have owned a home decorating company for two years and am familiar with dropshipping as well as buying from wholesalers. I feel like part of the job is helping people find a little something to take their minds off of possibly a very sad time, and I can do that.
I had some false starts before I started my own business. I learned that what I thought were fails really taught me valuable lessons in the world of business. I learned how to work with suppliers by having to deal with some rude people. But I also met some very helpful ones who guided me and who made me better. I just wanted to make people happy with items in my store that would make their homes more cheerful and comfortable.
I usually work alone, but some things require that I get out in the world. Things like research in finding what people like are something that is done in both going into stores as well as sitting on the sofa looking online. Something I have learned by researching is that by talking to people a little bit, I can get an idea of what might make them (or the person they're shopping for) smile. If someone can leave the gift shop with a smile on his or her face, that's a good thing.
As a Buyer, I would spend time in the store as well as just ordering inventory. If that would be acceptable to you, I would be very open to working out a schedule that would put me actually in the gift shop a few hours a week. Thank you for your time in considering my application.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am applying for the Production Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins Productions. As a Communications student at Coral Springs University, I am eager to take on a part-time or internship position. I work quickly and efficiently and am meticulously organized. I can craft and edit content while getting projects done on time. Putting my strengths to use, I am excited about the idea of helping Crane & Jenkins Productions, a company that produces first-rate entertainment.
I was recently the Development Intern at Cloud Clearwater Pictures. A goal of Cloud Clearwater Pictures' internship program is for students to get hands-on experience with the movie and television development process. While there, I researched pilots and films and helped decide which should go into production. I also managed desk duties, taking calls, responding to emails and setting up meetings. In addition, I helped talent and assisted with casting multiple features.
As a result of my role as Development Intern, I have gained experience reviewing and editing books and scripts. I am also skilled at writing press releases, articles and pitch summaries. Some of the announcements I wrote have since been used to publicize some of the most talked-about projects in the industry. My supervisor set a goal for me to make decisions on 50 films and pilots during my four-month stint. I made decisions on 100, surpassing that goal by 50.
Thank you for your consideration and time. Attached are my resume, letters of recommendation and a link to my portfolio, which features written and production work. Please let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to learning more about the Production Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins Productions, and I hope to hear from you soon.

I know that medical school is a challenging time and I can provide the calming influence and extra boost that certain students need. My passion for learning and teaching shines through to the students as they become excited and motivated to reach their goals.
I am a retired teacher with 32 years of experience teaching various science subjects to high school students. This background enables me to be able to help tutor students who are struggling with the science component of their education. Teaching difficult subjects has definitely taught me patience. There is no greater joy for me than to patiently guide a student to the correct answer. When a student has that ""aha!"" moment, all my efforts are worth it.
The Common Core standards are a useful yardstick for measuring how well students are doing. My students consistently met or exceeded the Common Core standards for science. I believe in working with each student's individual learning styles to help them understand the material. If students were struggling with a concept, I would figure out a different way to teach or apply that concept. I was voted Teacher of the Year six times in my career. I also won an award for Innovative Teaching Style at the 2011 National Teaching Conference.
Thank you for considering my application as a Tutor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you and discussing educational standards and the need for qualified tutors in medical school. Even though I'm retired, I still complete continuing education credits as a way to keep my brain limber and not be out of the educational loop. I am excited to apply my many years of teaching experience to help new students with difficult subjects.

This love of teaching also led me to create a personal blog showcasing proven techniques for improving bedside manner and enhancing patient relationships. The blog currently has more than 1,000 subscribers, ranging from first-year medical students to seasoned physical therapists.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more details about the Physical Therapist position and about Cloud Clearwater.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Caregiver position at Crane & Jenkins. As a highly empathetic and caring individual with extensive experience in the caregiving field, I am confident that I can succeed as a Caregiver at Crane & Jenkins, a trusted name in geriatric care since 1990.
During my tenure at River Tech, I provided home health care for a rotation of 10 patients per week, five days a week. My responsibilities included light housework, giving baths, preparing small snacks, reading to patients, helping them around the house, helping patients use the restroom, providing companionship, keeping track of appointments, and feeding patients. I am very passionate about the well-being of my patients. I believe that the elderly are a valuable and important generation, full of wisdom and knowledge and that they need to be cared for and protected.
During my teenage years, I served as a primary caregiver for my grandmother. As a frail woman in her late 90s, she needed a lot of assistance with most day-to-day functions. Since I was there more than my parents, who both worked full-time, I took it upon myself to be her caregiver. The more time I spent with her, the more I realized that although her body may not function, her mind was an ocean of stories and wisdom, waiting to be explored. I will always cherish the time I had with her and the things she taught me.
I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane & Jenkins and the expectations of the Caregiver role.

During my previous role in a warehouse position at Crane & Jenkins, my responsibilities included shipping and receiving products, preparing orders, sorting, placing, and organizing items, taking inventory, and upholding all safety standards.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I noticed the opening you have for a Dentist at Cloud Clearwater, and I am highly interested in the position. I believe my past experiences and personal skills would translate wonderfully to the opportunity within your organization.
I obtain great joy by helping people get healthy and stay safe. Dentistry allows me to do this while utilizing some of my best skills as a worker. In addition, my attention to detail and organizational acumen would make me a vital addition to Cloud Clearwater. I attended university at Hawaii Western to earn my dental degree. The time was extensive but worth every second. The program opened my eyes to what type of work ethic and desire is needed to succeed in this industry. Rather than scaring me away, it enticed me to work even harder to reach my goals.
After school, I began the process of immersing myself in the dental industry. I found assistant work at Crane & Jenkins. Though just a young pup in the field, I could tell that this position would (and did) help a great deal. I learned the ins and outs of day-to-day operations at a dental office. This included interacting with prospective as well as current clients. I fine-tuned my bedside manner and, of course, sat at the hip of the dentist in residency.
Since assistant work was hardly my end goal, I had to move on. But it wasn't without reservation. I enjoyed my time at Crane & Jenkins and will remember a number of the clients rather fondly. Building relationships is one of my main draws to the profession.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Sales Representative position at Retail Ocean. As an educated and experienced marketer, I believe I can exceed your expectations and increase sales for Retail Ocean.
My tenure at TradeLot proved to be a successful one. From day one I only gave my best. On the sales floor, I used many well-known marketing strategies as well as a few of my own techniques. During my first year, I increased sales on a product which had previously had not been selling very well by 50%. By my second year, I was a top five sales representative for TradeLot. Because of my success, I was able to attend several conferences, where I networked and learned new sales strategies from world-renowned experts. My demeanor as a sales representative is not pushy or ""salesy."" I believe that if a product will truly benefit a customer, then it is my duty to make them see how. I take time to learn about the customer and match them with a product that is best suited to their needs.
Ever since I was a child I have been interested in sales. I was always coming up with ""products"" to sell to my friends and family. From lemonade stands to peddling candy and duct tape wallets, I was born to sell. I saw school fundraisers as an opportunity to play salesperson even though I didn't make any money from it. I loved the rush of getting a customer to say yes to a product. In 2012, I graduated with my degree in Marketing from Coral Springs University.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Retail Ocean.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to inquire about the Veterinary Assistant position at TradeLot. With a biology M.A. from Hawaii Western and nearly a decade of real-world hospital experience, I believe that I would bring tremendous value to the table.
My wide breadth of knowledge includes extensive study of both the animal kingdom and the human body. In fact, while studying biology at Hawaii Western, I minored in zoology. Upon graduation, I worked as an intern at Cloud Clearwater Hospital. There, learning health and wellness techniques while treating basic injuries and illnesses was of vital importance. I learned how to organize patient lists, communicate with patients and families in a compassionate and productive manner, and supervise medical students.
After a year of moving up from the ranks of intern, I was offered a Veterinary Assistant job with Crane & Jenkins. There, I was able to apply my skills in a setting that exposed me directly to animals. I learned important skills like how to work with frightened animals and how to administer appropriate dosages of vaccine medications. My experiences have allowed me to work with dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and even horses.
Though I love my job at Crane & Jenkins, I'm eager to expand my skills and bring value to a larger and more challenging veterinary environment. I would be pleased to present references from my current and former employers, and I look forward to learning more about this exciting position.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm writing about the Veterinarian position in the hopes that my skills may be put to good use at Retail Ocean. I am a graduate of Green Valley State, where I studied biology and veterinary medicine under some of the nation's leading veterinary minds. I gained my medical degree at Hawaii Western with the lone goal of becoming a Veterinarian, and now I'm excited about the possibility of working for you.
My desire to become a Veterinarian began rather ordinarily. It grew from a love of animals as a child. That cookie-cutter origin story has led me to apply for the position of Veterinarian at Retail Ocean. Even though my desire for this position seems simple, I can assure you my passion and aptitude are not.
My passion for helping animals took me to a local shelter. There, I saw some of the hardships that abandoned and sick animals can go through. As I searched for work at a clinic, my time spent at the shelter made me aware of how animals are treated by supposedly intelligent adults. It only stoked my desires to help and heal these creatures.
With a medical background and an animal focus, there is no other career for me outside of veterinary work. I know Retail Ocean is the right place for me. While my experiences have brought me in contact with mostly household pets (cats and dogs), my studies have given me the knowledge to help many more animals than that. As one could attest to, it isn't enough to love animals. You have to take those next steps to really make a difference.
Sincerely,
Sofia Flores","The Retail Ocean Veterinarian position is a great opportunity for a passionate and experienced medical professional who loves animals.

To Whom It May Concern,
Many little boys and girls dream of becoming a Firefighter when they grow up. Rather than dreaming it so, I made it so and would love to continue the course of my career with the Crane & Jenkins company. I read about your opening for a new Firefighter and would be elated to join up. I feel strongly that my skills and experience would be a perfect match.
My dream of becoming a Firefighter didn't materialize out of nowhere. I actually began my service life as a Police Officer, albeit briefly. I attended police academy at Green Valley State, eventually passing and joining the force in town. The job wasn't what I was best at, though. Instead, firefighting was where my heart was. From the academy, I spent time as a volunteer fireman.
There are similarities between the careers. Both highlight my desire to serve and protect my community. Both require physical, mental, and emotional strength. These are all key aspects of my personality. I perform well under pressure and seem to rise to the occasion when there is a life to be saved.

I capture moments. My photography philosophy is to skip the posed, staged shots and get to the heart of the matter: love. From engagements to graduations to family photos, I work with love. In fact, I think that every truly beautiful moment deserves a photo to back it up. That's why I do what I do, and I would love to join the Cloud Clearwater team. With my vision and your resources, I'm sure we could make memories that will last lifetimes.
While studying photography at Hawaii Western, I began a small photography business to cater to those special moments we all have at university. I covered a few tropical weddings, capturing the essence of that magical time when man and woman become one, and I stood vigil as babies were brought into the church. Each of these affairs was intimate and full of emotion, and I was proud to be a part of their big moments, but I am ready to lend my talents to a larger firm.
I created a portfolio of the most creative and special moments I caught on camera and have achieved them both at @HaddingtonPhotography and on www.HaddingtonPhotography.com. In addition to my favorite pictures, I asked each of my clients to pick their favorite photo to be featured on social media or the website and why they loved it so much. This, I believe, helped market Haddington Photography to where it is today, and I would love to apply this strategy to a new position with Cloud Clearwater.

To Whom It May Concern,
A young Chef always dreams of creating their own menu. When I became aware of the opening at Cloud Clearwater, I knew it was the right opportunity for me to pursue. It would be a dream come true to even be seriously considered for this position of Chef. It would mean all my hard work was paying off.
I spent some time early in my life at Longford Tech. Though I didn't complete my full degree, it was five semesters well spent. My time at school helped me learn and focus on what I really wanted to do with my life: cook. Throughout school, besides attending business classes, I grew my hobby into my passion.
Instead of staying for my full degree at Longford Tech, I moved to a great opportunity when the time was right. The chance to work and create in a kitchen at a real restaurant was too intriguing to pass up. Though I wasn't creating the menu by any means, my position at TradeLot allowed me to do the next best thing. It prepared me for the work and desire it takes to create and run a menu, and I learned that the best dishes often come from tweaks to original plans.
If given the opportunity to create my own menu at Cloud Clearwater, I know I will not waste it. This is the chance I have been waiting for since leaving school early and seeking out my passion of cooking. Even before getting started, I know every test meal will not be a hit. However, I can promise that every piece of food that makes it to the customers will be my best effort.

Thank you for considering me as a candidate for the Nanny position at Crane & Jenkins. My experience with children paired with my education in Early Childhood Development makes me confident that Crane & Jenkins is a place where I can add value. It would give me great pleasure to become a part of your team.
As the oldest of five children, I played a major role in the upbringing of my two brothers and two sisters. My father was a hardworking man, but the role of child-raising was placed on my mother. As I got older, I began to take on more and more of the responsibilities associated with raising my siblings and running the house. As much of my time as it took up, I loved it. I knew I had developed a passion for caring for babies and young children. Their well-being was my biggest concern.
As my siblings became more self-sufficient, I began a babysitting service for my neighbors. During my four years of high school, I babysat three to four nights a week, and overall, I cared for about 50 babies and small children. I knew I had already found my dream job, but I wanted to make a living wage. I decided to attend Coral Springs University. I earned my degree in Early Childhood Development and continued babysitting throughout college.
Thank you for your consideration and time. I believe that my education and background with children will prove me an excellent candidate for the Nanny position at Crane & Jenkins.

Though I am new to the teaching profession, I have spent my life preparing for such a career. The desire to help children stems from the jobs I had growing up including babysitter, camp counselor, and nanny. I enjoyed everything about the process of watching, teaching, and helping children. Their wonder-filled eyes and minds are meant to be shaped and aided. There is nothing more rewarding than doing just that.
In addition to my work experience, my education makes me an excellent candidate for the job. I earned my B.A. in early childhood education at Hawaii Western, and I minored in childhood development. While there, I served at my local church as a Sunday School teacher for fourth and fifth graders.
I have experience working as an assistant in the classroom. It was just the start I needed for this next jump. At the school, I was responsible for designing fun and engaging projects for the kids. This included making a game of learning letters and numbers. We gave backstories and identities to each symbol to ingrain them in the children's minds. It was a fun take on the preschool lexicon, one that I hope to continue at Cloud Clearwater.

I've been serving communities in my hometown since I was 17 and working as a Police Explorer, and I have always been praised for my commitment to helping community members in need. I have also been told that I am attuned to people's body language, which further helps me identify people's motives and solve problems.
As part of my most recent role as Community Officer at the River Tech Police Department, I fostered relationships with employees at local public retail centers, such as gas stations, shops, and grocery stores. Community members in these roles can be eyes and ears for law enforcement, and gaining them as allies is helpful for obtaining leads during an investigation or while in pursuit of a suspect. It's also important to gain the trust of community members because they will be more likely to call and ask for assistance if they encounter a patron of their store who is being disruptive on their premises or in the community.
I am also attentive to procedures, and I am able to testify in cases that I have been involved with. My attention to detail has been noted on my performance appraisals, and I am often told that the reports that I write are impeccable and allow court proceedings to be conducted smoothly.

Dear Hiring Manager,
Once upon a time, my mom thought she lost me in the library, but I was actually hiding in the stacks, organizing the books in a dusty corner of the Green Valley State Library. Naturally, when I saw this job posting, I was thrilled to apply for the Library Assistant opening at Cloud Clearwater. I would love nothing more than to channel my near-obsessive love for organization and books to this position.
While I have no direct work experience in the library science field, I have volunteered as the Library Assistant for Ms. Jenkins, the librarian at my high school, since I was in the eighth grade. For the most part, my job was to reshelve books, so I became very accustomed to the Dewey Decimal System as a point of interest and a necessity. Not only that but I also aided Ms. Jenkins in a complete revamp of our library's technological system that, before our intervention, hadn't been updated since the 90s, so I understand the databases and skills necessary to logically work in a library setting.
I am confident that I am ready to take the next step in my journey to librarianship. I am comfortable with teaching patrons new research methods and helping book seekers use the catalog, and I am excited to start a new phase in my life as not only a Library Assistant but also as a lover of books, libraries, and everything in between.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon to set up an interview. I can be reached at either ihaddington@email.com or (123) 456-7891.

I am excited to apply for the Physician Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins. When I graduated from Northwest Vermont University three years ago, I knew that I wanted to work in delivering primary health care services because I believe that's where I can have the most impact on the daily lives of people. I am intrigued by the Physician Assistant position you seek to fill at Crane & Jenkins because of the inroads you are making in community health education and improving health outcomes for underserved populations.
With my Physician Assistant role at Cloud Clearwater, I examined, diagnosed, and counseled approximately 60 patients each day. My goal was to appropriately treat any acute conditions while educating my patients and their families to promote comprehensive wellness and maintain chronic illness treatment. To ensure all patient needs were met, I coordinated with the physician and health care staff while making referrals for additional intervention when necessary.
In addition to my strong medical judgment and communication skills, I am adept at learning new technologies. At Cloud Clearwater, I established myself as the in-house expert on the DocuTAP Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. My ability to leverage technology resulted in me meeting our goal of an averaging less than an hour in-office for the patient. As such, my patient satisfaction rating was always 95% or higher.

To Whom It May Concern,
I have two passions in life. The first is creating and nurturing art. The second is working with children to help them create as well. I cannot help but think the opportunity to become an Art Teacher at River Tech is the perfect place for me. My love of art started at a very young age. I was constantly drawing, painting, sewing, and frankly, ruining. Not all art generated by a child is going to be beneficial! But from staining a few too many surfaces at my parents' house, I grew passionate about my skills.
I took the next step by attending Longford Tech. Teaching wasn't immediately on my radar, but it soon followed. I honed my craft while simultaneously expanding my horizons. A love of art grew into a love of helping others with their art, and eventually, teaching others.
After graduation, I worked at Retail Ocean, a studio in town. Not all students were children, which actually worked to my benefit. I learned the different patterns necessary to teach students of all ages and skill levels. And just because someone is older does not mean they are more advanced in a specific technique or craft. The balance aided me greatly as I moved to working exclusively with children.
Even children have vastly different learning curves. And finding each student's learning technique is part of the fun. Seeing a young child create a piece of art after hardly knowing the first step to doing so is a joy that cannot be matched. Becoming an Art Teacher at River Tech would stoke this joy, and I would love to be considered for the position.

During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for protecting the people and the property of the company. Each day I performed a morning and evening inspection of the premises.

During my tenure at Cloud Clearwater High School, I was a guidance counselor for approximately 300 freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. My duties included scheduling classes, resolving conflict between students, making class schedules for each student and setting up accommodations for students with special needs. I take pride in providing each student with compassion and care because some students don't get that from home. I counseled many students who came from broken homes. Their parents were drug addicts or missing. Some students were abused. It was heartbreaking. I made sure to be a role model and mentor to students as well as a listening ear. I took student concerns very seriously.
My success as a counselor is rooted in my education from Coral Springs University. I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology with a minor in secondary education. I have known I wanted to help people since I was a young girl. My family had several issues that my high school guidance counselor helped me resolve.

My teaching experience began as a graduate assistant at Green Valley State. There, balancing my own schoolwork with teaching, I learned to appreciate both sides of the student dynamic. Students often take teachers for granted, and teachers often expect too much or predict too little of their students. Being able to witness both sides simultaneously was a real benefit to my growth.

My coaching career began as a graduate assistant in school. I worked while attending Coral Springs University. While it was occasionally tricky to balance school with my duties as an Assistant Coach, the work was entirely worth it. I wouldn't be where I am today without that start.
After graduating, I stayed on at CSU to continue helping the staff. My position was upgraded, as were my responsibilities. This was the jump I was looking for. Helping the students with their own school and sports balance was a dream. It wasn't always easy, but that made it feel even better when results were witnessed.
My first big break came in the form of a full-time Assistant Coaching position at Hawaii Western. As an assistant, I was tasked with forming my own game plans, making in-game adjustments, and constantly teaching the kids what was necessary to find success. It isn't everyone who is as fortunate as me to be able to do what they love as a career. While that has remained true, my wish is to lead Green Valley State as Head Coach.

I enjoy the challenge of keeping detailed records and always following a meticulous pattern for achieving the most accurate results.
My passion for science motivated me to attend Coral Springs University as soon as I finished high school. I graduated with a bachelor's of science degree and finished in the top 10% of my class.

To Whom It May Concern,
I saw the job posting for the position of Program Coordinator at your facility and would love to be considered for it. I believe my strengths, passion, and experience line up perfectly with this opportunity, and I know I would become a vital part of the Coral Springs University team.
Working at CSU would not be my first taste of program and event management in a collegiate atmosphere. During my time as a hospitality and tourism management undergrad at Hawaii Western, I interned with the facilities department. There, I received a crash course in setting up and preparing for large events. We also interacted with prospective and current clients and followed up with them after each event.
After graduation, I moved into the nonprofit world. I worked as a Recreation Coordinator for the Parks and Recreation Department in Turtle Bay, Hawaii. While our events were normally on a smaller scale than they were at Hawaii Western, the steps we needed to take were similar. Coordinating an event of any size includes specific, necessary steps to make the client happy and guarantee the event proceeds as planned.
Between my time helping with the facilities and events department to working as a Recreation Coordinator, I believe I have followed just the right stepping stones to becoming the Program Coordinator at Coral Springs University. I am familiar with an academic atmosphere and I love the enthusiasm that exists in such an environment. CSU sounds like a place that employs passionate and hardworking folks, which is just the kind of group I'd like to join as Program Coordinator.

I read about your online posting for Actors for a new film in town and would love to be considered for a part. I have been working toward my dream of becoming a full-time Actor for years now, and a role in your Cloud Clearwater Productions film could be the vital next step in my journey.
My love of acting developed at an early age. I was on the stage as soon as I could walk. I starred in films as a young child when I was in middle school as well as high school. I took part in local town performances as well. Once I attended school at Hawaii Western, my acting took a turn. I majored in Theater Arts, really putting my skills and passion to the test.
Besides performing in plays through school, I also continued to monitor for local performances and opportunities. I take pride in admitting the parts I gained over the years from college to today. I was fortunate enough to star in three major productions: ""Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat,"" ""Othello,"" and a version of ""The Lion King"" that showed my stage athleticism.
I have also played key parts in plays and films that didn't include a starring role. Side and complementary characters are often just as important to the execution of a story as the main character is. They often bring the problem and/or the climax. They can aid the hero in reaching a goal. Oftentimes, the ultimate success or failure of a project depends on the supporting cast, and I know this intimately. I hope to be a part of that cast in your endeavor to show just what I can do.

I have been working in the engineering field for several years, and during that time I have been a part of multiple projects, including ones that focused on the maintenance of several roads and the design of Cloud Clearwater Bridge. I am particularly detail oriented, and I have always been praised for my ability to foresee potential problems and make proactive plans.
In my previous role as Civil Engineer, I was responsible for examining the stability of the bridge that we were building and assessing how it would withstand an earthquake. I also helped with the maintenance and upgrading of several roads that needed drainage to make the roads safer for travel and improve the longevity of the road's surface.
I am not only attentive to detail when designing and maintaining roads and bridges. I am also attentive to the criticism of others, and I highly value feedback that will make my projects run more smoothly. I appreciate straightforward yet relaxed professional interactions, and I aim for that dynamic with all of my colleagues and outside contacts.
I sincerely look forward to further discussing the role of Civil Engineer at River Tech. I'm also excited to hear more about some of the projects that River Tech has been involved in as well as any projects in the foreseeable future. I appreciate your time in considering me for this position.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am interested in the Human Resources Coordinator position for Cloud Clearwater and the opportunity it provides to design e-learning resources for employee training and development. In my current role, my primary duties include guiding employees through the benefits sign-up process and ensuring that they follow through with evaluating and making changes to insurance benefits during the open enrollment period. Recently, I developed five e-learning modules that employees can access online to review their benefit options during the open enrollment period.
The modules have been very helpful because employees can now review benefits carefully before they make decisions about changes or additions. Employees and family members can access the modules anytime. Prior to my developing this online presentation, employees were required to attend face-to-face benefits updates during the workday, prior to beginning work, or after hours.
Upper management and my Human Resources Manager have been supportive and recognize that using technology is an efficient way to reach employees with important information. However, with limited staff, the company is unable to create a position specifically for this task. In fact, when I developed the modules, I did most of the work after hours during personal time.
Based on what I know about your company, my ability to develop high-quality e-learning resources would be an asset. I have worked for five years in my current position, so I bring knowledge of many areas related to human resources, including interviewing, coordinating benefits, orienting new employees and writing articles for the company newsletter. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to discuss how I can design e-learning resources that will benefit the employees at Cloud Clearwater.

During my previous role at River Tech, I was primarily responsible for meeting the needs of patients in the memory care facility. In an effort to improve patient care, I pioneered a training program designed to educate staff and help them understand the care experience from the patient's point of view. Not only did we see a 40% increase in client satisfaction ratings, but we also found a significant improvement in employee engagement and retention in this department.
I have extensive training in medical services as well as record management and office administration. Beyond these technical skills, I also pride myself on my ability to build deep relationships with the patients in my care. I received our facility's prestigious Daisy Award in 2015 for excellence in patient care and have been praised by three River Tech department managers for my ability to multitask while still ensuring quality personal interactions with every patient and their families.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Property Manager position at Retail Ocean, a trusted name in home rentals. As an upbeat professional with over 10 years of property management experience, I am confident in my ability to perform at Retail Ocean.
During my tenure as Property Manager for Crane & Jenkins, my responsibilities included calculating rental rates for our homes, advertising, showing homes to potential tenants, collecting rent, creating an annual budget, contracting repairs when needed and enforcing company policies. I interacted with clients and tenants in a professional manner and made sure to address any concerns as quickly as possible.
Before I worked at Crane & Jenkins, I helped my father manage properties for his small business. He had 10 properties when I was 12. As his business expanded to over 30 homes and I grew up, I became more involved in helping him manage properties. He taught me how to interact with tenants and taught me what to do and what not to do when a tenant damages property or is behind on rent. I believe that a Property Manager should always be considerate of the needs of their tenants. My father never allowed a repair to go unaddressed. If a tenant called and said something was broken, he made sure to get someone to the property as soon as possible. I carry that same sense of urgency in my work.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Retail Ocean and its clients.

I look forward to using my observation skills as a valuable member of Retail Ocean.

I have spent the past four years at Northwest Vermont University learning how to be the best Counselor I can possibly be, and I am confident that I would excel in the School Counselor position at Crane & Jenkins Academy.

Being able to help my fellow students get through their day-to-day hardships was an uplifting experience, and through that experience, I was able to learn about several different mental disorders and also about different cultures. Now, I believe I have a stronger understanding of what it is like to give of myself and to help people of all backgrounds.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the Pharmacist position at Crane & Jenkins. As a pharmacist who consistently demonstrates a strong attention to detail while providing excellent customer service, I am motivated by helping people be as healthy as possible by accurately filling their prescriptions and offering informed advice. I am looking forward to the possibility of bringing my approach to pharmacy and patient counseling to Crane & Jenkins, renowned for providing comprehensive community health services.
During my previous role at Retail Ocean, I oversaw all pharmacy operations and led a team of eight pharmacy technicians and three junior pharmacists. While working in this fast-paced, high volume environment, I accurately processed more than 35,000 prescriptions each month while counseling diverse patients. I developed successful relationships with doctors, medical staff, insurance companies, and patients.
I am dedicated to ensuring pharmacy compliance requirements are met by ensuring consistent adherence to all requisite laws. I facilitated compliance audits to proactively address any deficiencies and led quarterly compliance trainings for my team. Hoping to reduce the likelihood of contraindication, I implemented a policy of reviewing our patient's prescription history prior to distributing new medications. This additional step caught prescription errors and contributed to my team maintaining a consistent 98% satisfaction rate on Retail Ocean customer satisfaction surveys.
Thank you for your consideration and taking the time to review my application. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the Pharmacist position and Crane & Jenkins. Effective pharmacists must remain calm under pressure while maintaining perfect accuracy. My ability to do this and communicate positively with patients will add value to your team and the community you serve. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Sincerely,

Dear School Board,
I'm excited to apply for the position of Special Education Teacher at Cloud Clearwater. Your school notably has one of the best special education departments in the city, and I would love to be a part of it. I would love to learn more from the other teachers and bring my own ideas to the department to help make it even better.
I have been a Special Education Teacher at Crane & Jenkins for three years. During this time, I became skilled at working with parents and in the development of IEPs. I had about 20 students each day and saw much improvement in their skills throughout each year. I had two aides who worked with me. I was able to train them in such a way that they needed very little supervision. This allowed me more time to attend to paperwork and the development of curriculum.
Integration into regular classes was an important aspect of the program at Crane & Jenkins. During the course of my three years as the Special Education Teacher there, I was able to accomplish an integration of 25% in some children and up to 100% in others depending on the disabilities and needs of the child involved.
Thank you for the time and consideration you have put into my application. I feel that special education is a very important part of our schools. I would like very much to be a part of the special education department at Cloud Clearwater. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about this position.
Sincerely,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I was informed of your opening for Event Coordinator at TradeLot and knew I must apply. This position lines up perfectly with my skills, experiences, and goals for the future. I previously attended Hawaii Western, earning my degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. By working through real-world examples, we learned the ins and outs of many customer-focused businesses. Side work also gave me a solid background in finance and honed my organizational skills.
It wasn't enough to learn about customer service, though. I had to experience that for myself. After graduating, I became a Facilities and Events Assistant at Coral Springs University. There, I gained the entire blueprint of what an Event Coordinator is all about.
Coordinating an event is about more than renting out a space. A room must be prepped. It must be organized and set up to the specifications of the client. Events must be monitored throughout. And when the event wraps, a coordinator's job is not done. There is follow-up that must be adhered to. Though CSU was not hosting events as a for-profit enterprise, our department still worked through each step of the process.
From CSU, I moved onto Cloud Clearwater Inn. This gave me personal knowledge of what happens when we are using it as a profit generator. It was yet another side of being an Event Coordinator. My hope to appease the client and do my best to adhere to their desires is what will make me a perfect fit at TradeLot.
Sincerely,
Sofia Flores","The ideal candidate for this position will have a degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management from an accredited institution, as well as experience working in customer service and event coordination.

I am not just another young adult looking for a job at a coffee shop. I live and breathe coffee, and I absolutely adore Cloud Clearwater. I am excited to apply for the Barista opening at Cloud Clearwater because I am passionate about foam, caffeine, and smiling, and I love the inviting atmosphere.
At my last position as Barista for the coffee shop at Retail Ocean, I perfected our signature coffee swirl in a record two weeks. In 14 days, I learned to not only make the lattes themselves but also craft an absolutely perfect Retail Ocean wave atop the steaming cup, and I know that I could quickly learn to craft any foam creation for this new position. Beyond that, I would love to branch out from my coffee interests to pastries, teas, and the other menu items offered at Cloud Clearwater.
I am outgoing, extroverted, and would easily blend with the already vibrant staff employed with Cloud Clearwater. I work extremely well under pressure, and I am able to grin on cue despite the morning and evening rushes that might stress some people out. In addition to all of these skills, I also have a fantastic memory and have been known to memorize drink orders to faces, therefore speeding up clogged lines.

The new system increased the number of appointments by 40%.
I am attentive to the needs of my patients and strive to create a relaxing environment and to ensure their comfort during cleanings. As a consummate professional, I enjoy challenging cases. For instance, many of my patients at River Tech had advanced gingivitis, so I became extremely vigilant to any signs of pain or distress.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am delighted to be applying for the position of Chemical Engineer at Flagship Engineering. I believe that I bring the right combination of analytical acumen, persistence, precision workmanship, technical knowledge of chemistry and management experience to be a good fit for this role and to be able to contribute something of value to your organization. I always feel at home working in the lab, and I bring a strong commitment to precision to every test, experiment or project that I'm involved with.
These values have been with me throughout my career, dating all the way back to my student days. I did my graduate work in applied chemistry at St. Helena University and was able to graduate with high honors with my instructors giving me praise for my exact and careful work in the lab. From there, I began working at Foundry Petrochemicals with an excellent team of Chemical Engineers. Together, we sought to find ways to produce cheap, durable and heat-resistant plastics, running exhaustive stress tests on thousands of materials and eventually succeeding in creating a new plastic compound at low cost that was 20% more durable than any other that then existed.
As I progressed in my career, I also began to acquire management experience coordinating factory workers and chemists and instructing them on how to synthesize and to produce materials according to very exact specifications. Throughout, I have kept abreast of all new developments in the field. Notwithstanding my management experience, nothing quite gives me as much pleasure as working in the lab.
I graciously thank you for your time and consideration. It is my hope that we'll soon be able to move forward with the hiring process and that I will be given an opportunity to show off my skills and to demonstrate to you the kind of contributions that I would be able to make as a member of the research team at Flagship. Considering the importance of petrochemicals to so much of what we take for granted in our lives, it would truly be an honor to work with such an elite team of engineers and researchers and make contributions to the welfare of humankind.

Dear Hiring Manager,
One of my strongest desires is to help nurture and care for children. When I saw the opening for Babysitter at Crane & Jenkins, it felt like the perfect opportunity and something I must pursue. I have been doing jobs in this capacity since I was young myself. Starting out as a camp counselor, I was responsible for watching groups of children ranging from 8 to 20 kids. Besides keeping them out of danger, I also created games and schedules for my groups to follow.
Though counselor work was just during summers, I branched off into babysitting during the school months. It turned out this was perfect for me. I began that ""career"" with just three different children under my watch on different days of the week. Through word of mouth and the barest of marketing strategies, I tripled my client list within three months of starting out.
That growth was thanks to a good neighborhood but also my skill and success at the job. Though babysitting doesn't require as much activity as being a camp counselor, it is more focused on safety and care. Those are things that are vitally important to me. Keeping a child safe must be the main focus of a Babysitter.
At Crane & Jenkins, I know there is a new vibe compared to what I am used to. Rather than going to the child's home, the child comes to us. That should work to my benefit as I grow comfortable with the environment. It will begin to feel like the child is coming to my home turf, which makes keeping them safe and happy even easier.

Dear Hiring Manager,
I am quite thrilled to apply for the Finance Manager position at Flagship Engineering. My approach to financial management for my employer is to provide sound financial direction in each and every way to ensure confidence, growth, savings and profitability. It is also my intent to improve the quality of life for all employees by giving back during my own time with tips for personal financial management.
One of my primary focuses whilst working for Flagship Engineering was to cut costs without having to eliminate jobs. I initially faced challenges when faced with the possibility of budget cuts. I remained diligent in my objective without compromising the status quo as dictated by higher-ups about the alternative of layoffs. Once the company announced it was cut costs or lose jobs, the teams worked to implement the necessary changes.
In the end, I was able to find ways to eliminate budgets by 12% in each department and keep the jobs of four people. I also worked with department heads to reduce job redundancies and create new positions in areas that were lacking. This resulted in an increase in productivity of roughly 27%. I also implemented a personal finance program as a way to help all employees better save for their futures and make the most out of their paychecks. The results were a reported increase in overall job satisfaction by 37% and retention rates of 21% higher annually.
Thank you so much for your consideration and time. I feel your directive to treat your employees as assets are in alignment with my approach as a Finance Manager. Together, we can make the lives of the Flagship Engineering team and the business sustainable and a tremendous, long-term success.
Sincerely,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Financial Analyst position at Cloud Clearwater. As a detail-oriented analyst with a passion for numbers, I am thrilled at the chance to develop successful strategic financial models based on my data-driven insights and wealth of industry expertise.
With more than seven years as a Financial Analyst at River Tech, I held the responsibility of analyzing and refining intricate FP&A models for privately held, multimillion-dollar global organizations. I developed a series of recurring reports that enhanced our forecasting and budgeting processes. Those reports also significantly improved visibility into our clients' revenue, expense and functional operations. River Tech's executive team leveraged those reports to grow the company's revenue by more than 28% over the last two years.
During my decade of experience in the financial industry, I've developed a talent for distilling complex financial data into clear, concise and actionable reports that support executive decision-making. Senior leadership commended me at River Tech for my ability to think strategically and anticipate future industry trends and company needs. In late 2009, I developed a model that highlighted several market red flags; that awareness prevented the company from executing a merger that would have failed during the 2011 ""Black Monday"" market crash.
I am confident that my extensive technical skills along with my proven track record of industry success would make me a great fit for guiding Cloud Clearwater's market strategy. I'm looking forward to a having a conversation about the Financial Analyst position and Cloud Clearwater.
Sincerely,
Ivy Haddington","The Financial Analyst position at Cloud Clearwater is responsible for analyzing and refining intricate FP&A models for privately held, multimillion-dollar global organizations.

To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing in regard to the opening I saw for Security Guard at Retail Ocean. Your company seems like an exciting and challenging place to work, and I know I would fit right in. Thanks to my protective nature and past work experience, I would be a perfect fit for your Security Guard position.
My career began soon after high school. I attended Longford Tech, and upon graduation, I transitioned into the workforce. I worked at TradeLot as a maintenance assistant for five years. This was time well spent. Not only did I learn the ins and outs of professional life, but I also gained valuable knowledge of what it meant to be responsible and accountable.
From maintenance work, I moved on to Coral Springs University. I was working for the facilities department, and this proved to be a tremendous experience. The facilities department at a university is responsible for so many critical tasks: upkeep of the buildings, preparation and cleanup after events, and security of facilities and personnel. It was a broad-reaching and educational growth experience.
Being a Security Guard at Retail Ocean combines a number of the factors I am looking for in a career. I enjoy the process and efficiency of securing a building, either overnight or during an event. A qualified Security Guard must serve as an impenetrable line of protection for the company, and I am more than up to the task. I am an open person with a friendly demeanor, but I have keen instincts and pay impeccable attention to detail. I will remain committed to ensuring that your business remains secure but also a welcoming environment.
Sincerely,
Malik Rabb","The candidate should have experience in security, maintenance, and facility management. They should be able to operate independently and be detail oriented. The candidate should also be friendly and approachable.","Malik Rabb
