# Coverletter_generator-using-FLANT5-and-ChatGPT

The goal of this project is to build a fine-grained mini-ChatGPT (named “CoverGenie”) , which is designed to generate resumes and cover letters based on job descriptions from the tech field. By nature,it is a language generation task, and it takes the job description as input to a sequence of text and turns it into a structured, certain style of resumes and cover letters. This might involve parameter efficient finetuning, reinforcement learning and prompting engineering to some extent.
